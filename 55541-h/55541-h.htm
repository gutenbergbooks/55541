<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/hr1.jpg" width="100" height="15" alt="Decorative line" />
</div>

<p>In preparing this treatise on Dry Rot, the author has
endeavoured to place in as condensed a form as was consistent
with the nature of the subject, the knowledge and
information dispersed through a numerous collection of
writers who have treated thereon; he has also availed
himself of the assistance of professional friends, builders,
timber-merchants, foremen and carpenters; and, by so
doing, has been enabled to record several instances of the
progress and cure of dry rot. He has consulted many
valuable papers published during the last thirty years, in
the various professional journals in England, America,
France, and Germany, upon this important subject, and
has also obtained much useful information from the works
of Evelyn, Nicholson, Tredgold by Hurst, Papworth, Burnell,
Blenkarn, and other English writers upon timber;
Silloway, of North America; Porcher, of South America;
Du Hamel, De Moray, and De Lapparent, of France; and
several writers whose works will be referred to.</p>

<p>It is many years since a separate and complete work on
dry rot has been published, and those who are desirous of
inquiring into the matter are frequently at a loss where
to obtain any information. Existing works on the subject
are out of print, and although they can be seen at a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
professional institutes, they are beyond the reach of the
general public.</p>

<p>It has been the aim of the author in preparing this
treatise to give a fair hearing to every patentee, and he
has endeavoured to be as impartial as possible in recording
instances of failure and success. If he has erred in
any particular case, he will be happy, should this work
reach a second edition, to make any necessary correction.</p>

<p>The reader will probably find some things repeated in
the course of the work; this is in many cases unavoidable,
and in some advisable; for if by a little tautology important
truths can be impressed upon the mind of the
reader, the author will feel that his labour in preparing
this work has not been altogether in vain.</p>

<p>Modern authorities have been relied upon in preference
to ancient ones: the following sentence, written by the
late Sydney Smith, is quoted as a reason for so doing:</p>

<p>“Those who come first (our ancestors) are the young
people, and have the least experience. We have added
to their experience the experience of many centuries;
and, therefore, as far as experience goes, are wiser, and
more capable of forming an opinion than they were.”</p>

<h1>A TREATISE ON DRY ROT IN TIMBER.</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF TIMBER.</span></h2>

<p>In considering the subject of Timber trees, we commence
with their Elementary Tissues, and first in order is the
<i>Formative Fluid</i>, which is the sole cause of production of
every tissue found in trees. It is semi-fluid, and semi-transparent,
and in this condition is found abundantly
between the bark and the wood of all trees in early spring;
and thus separates those parts so as to permit the bundles
of young wood to pass down from the leaves, and thus
enable the tree to grow. It is under these conditions
that the woodman strips the bark from trees which are to
be cut down, since then it does not adhere to the wood.</p>

<p>The first step in the formation of any tissue from the
formative fluid is the production of a solid structureless
fabric called <i>Elementary Membrane</i>, and a modification of
that fabric termed <i>Elementary Fibre</i>.</p>

<p>The structures which are produced from the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
“raw material” are very varied in appearance,
and are called <i>Cellular Tissues</i>, to signify that they are
made up of hollow cells. The spaces between the cells are
called <i>Intercellular Spaces</i>, which are of vital importance,
as they contain air. <i>Woody fibre</i> constitutes the mass of
the stems of our forest trees. Its peculiar characteristic
is that of great tenacity, and power of resistance, and for
this its structure is admirably adapted: it consists of
bundles of very narrow fibres, with tapering extremities,
and is so placed from end to end, that the pointed ends
overlap each other. Each fibre is very short, and the partitions
which result from the apposition of the fibres, end to
end, do not interfere with the circulation through them.
The tube is not composed of simple thin membranes only;
but in addition has a deposit within it, which, without
filling the tube, adds very greatly to the strength of the
fibre: an arrangement whereby the greatest strength and
power of resistance and elasticity shall be obtained; and,
at the same time, the functions of circulation uninterruptedly
maintained. The strength is mainly due to the
shortness of each fibre, the connection by opposite ends of
many fibres, almost in one direct line, from the root upwards;
and lastly, to the deposit on the inner side of the
membrane. The uses of woody fibre are very varied and
most important; it is the chief organ of circulation in all
wooded plants, and, for this purpose, pervades the plant
from the root to the branches. The current in this tissue
is directed upwards from the shoot, through the stem to
the leaves, and downwards from the leaves through the
bark to the root. Thus, its current has a twofold tendency;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the ascending and chief one being for the purpose
of taking the raw, or what is called the <i>common sap</i>, from
the ground to be digested in the leaves, and the descending
being devoted to the removal from the leaves of the
digested, or what is termed the <i>proper sap</i>, to be applied
to the purposes of the tree, and also of the refuse matter
to be carried to the roots, and thence thrown out into the
soil as a noxious material. The <i>proper sap</i> differs considerably
in different trees; it is always less liquid, and
contains a much greater proportion of vegetable matter
than the common sap. It is very probable that trees of
the same kind produce proper sap of different qualities in
different climates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woody Fibre</span> may be considered the storehouse of the
perfected secretions. It is well known that as trees advance
in life, the wood assumes a darker colour, and more
particularly that lying near to the centre of the stem.
This is due to the deposit of the perfected juices in the
woody fibre at that point; and where age has matured the
tree, it is probable that the woody fibre so employed is no
longer fitted for the circulation of the sap; and, also, that
the perfected sap, when once deposited, does not again join
in the general circulation. The dark colour of the heart
of oak, as contrasted with oak of very recent growth, is an
illustration of this fact, as is also the deep colour which is
met with in ebony and rose-wood. Technically, the inner
wood is called the heart-wood, and the outer or younger
wood the sap-wood. Of these, the former contains little
fluid, and no vegetable life, and, being the least liable to
decay, is therefore the most perfect wood; the latter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
soft and perishable in its nature, abounding in fermentable
elements; thus affording the very food for worms,
whose destructive inroads hasten its natural tendency to
decay.</p>

<p>The proportion of sap-wood in different trees varies very
much. Spanish chestnut has a very small proportion of
sap-wood, oak has more, and fir a still larger proportion
than oak; but the proportions vary according to the situation
and soil, and according to the age at which they have
been felled: for instance, the teak tree in Malabar, India,
differs from teak in Anamalai, South India. This subject
has been very fully treated by Mr. Patrick Williams, in
his valuable work on Naval Timber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wooded Stems</span> are divided into two great and well-defined
classes, according to their internal conformation,
viz. such as grow from without (exogenous), and such as
enlarge from within (endogenous). The former are more
common in cold, and the latter in hot climates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exogenous Stems.</span>&mdash;On examining a section of a stem
of an oak, or any other of our forest trees, we observe the
following parts: first, the pith, or its remains in the centre;
second, the bark on the outside; third, a mass of wood
between the two, broken up into portions by the concentric
deposition of the layers, and by a series of lines which pass
from the centre to the circumference. Thus, there are
always pith, bark, wood, and medullary rays. Each stem
has two systems, the cellular or horizontal, and the
vascular or longitudinal, and the parts just mentioned
must belong to one or other of those systems. Thus,
the pith, medullary rays, and bark belong to the horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
system; and the wood constitutes the longitudinal
system.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pith</span> occupies the centre of the stem, and remains
throughout the period of growth of some trees, as of the
elder; or is abstracted after a few years, as in the oak,
and almost all large trees. In the latter class of trees,
there are some remains of the pith for many years after
the process of absorption has commenced, but at length no
vestige can be detected, and its position is known only
by the central spot around which the wood is placed in
circles. In the old age of the tree the pith frequently
assumes a colour which it has obtained from the juices
which have been deposited. The connections of the pith
are extremely important. Firstly, it is in direct connection
with every branch, and is the structure which first conveys
fluids to, and receives fluids from every new leaf. It
thence becomes the main organ of nutriment, and, at the
same time, the chief depository of the secretions. Secondly,
it is in equally direct and unbroken connection with the
bark, through the medium of the medullary rays; and so
becomes the centre of all the movements of sap which
proceed in the horizontal system.</p>

<p>The mode in which the ultimate disappearance of the
pith occurs has been a matter of speculation. That the
circulation in the heart-wood ceases after a certain
number of years, and that the connection between it and
the bark becomes broken, is proved by the fact that
numbers of trees may be found in tolerably vigorous
growth within the bark, whereas at the heart they are
decayed and rotten. It appears clear that it is not converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
into wood, and there are facts against the opinion
that it is gradually compressed by the wood; but since it
is known that in the growth of the tree much compression
of the previously formed wood must occur, and since this
compression is a likely theory by which to account for the
disappearance of the less resisting pith, it is now generally
considered to be one of the causes of this occurrence. As
a general rule, the pith, so long as it exists, is not mingled
with other than cellular structures; but, in certain
instances, wooden fibre has been found with it, and, in
others, spiral vessels have been detected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medullary Sheath.</span>&mdash;Immediately surrounding the
pith of all exogenous plants, there is a layer of longitudinal
tissue, which has received the name of medullary
sheath. This sheath has no special walls, but is bounded
by the pith on the inner, and the wood on the outer side.
It is in this situation that ducts of various kinds and
spiral vessels may be found, and in all cases it conveys the
longitudinal structure from the root, direct to each leaf.
The integrity of this structure is therefore highly necessary
to the life of the tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medullary Rays.</span>&mdash;These structures come next in
order, and, as has been previously intimated, belong to
the horizontal cellular system of the stem; they constitute
the channel of communication between the bark and the
pith, and are composed of a series of walls of single cells
resting upon the root, and proceeding to the top of the
tree, and radiating from the centre. They lie between
the wedge-like blocks of wood, and as they have a lighter
colour than the wood, they are evident on an oblique section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of any stem, and are called the silver grain. Their
colour and number suffice to enable anyone to distinguish
various kinds of wood, and greatly increase their beauty.
They cannot, of course, exist before the wood is formed,
and are therefore not met with in very young trees. They
commence to exist with the first deposited layers of wood,
and continue to grow outwardly, or nearest to the bark, so
long as the wood continues to be deposited. In those
woods which possess in abundance the silver grain,
another source of ornament exists, viz. a peculiar damask
or dappled effect, somewhat similar to that artificially
produced on damask linens, moreens, silks, and other
fabrics, the patterns on which result from certain masses
of the threads on the face of the cloth running lengthways,
and other groups crossways. This effect is observable
in a remarkable degree in the more central planks of
oak, especially in Dutch wainscot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bark.</span>&mdash;As the medullary rays terminate in the
bark, on their outer side, the consideration of that part
next follows. It forms the sheath of the tree, and its
more immediate use is that of giving protection to the
wood. If bark did not exist, there would be no formative
fluid, and without formative fluid there could not be
any deposit of woody fibre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wood.</span>&mdash;We find wood occupying nearly the whole
body of the trunk of the tree, and arranged, as a rule, in
a very regular manner. On taking up any piece of wood,
but more particularly the entire section of a stem, we
first notice a series of circles, which increase in diameter
and separate by wider intervals as we approach the bark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
In this manner the trunk is composed of numerous zones
enclosed within each other. Again, in almost all trees,
the medullary rays before mentioned may be observed
passing in straight lines from the centre to the circumference;
and, as the circle of the stem at the bark is much
larger than any circle near to the centre, it follows that
the medullary rays will be wider apart at the bark than
at the pith. On this view of the subject it may be stated
that the stem is composed of a series of wedge-shaped
blocks, which have their edges meeting at the centre.
The combination of these two views gives the correct idea
of the arrangement of the wood, viz. a series of wedges,
each divided into segments of unequal width by circular
lines passing across them. From this description it must
not be imagined that these various portions are detached
from each other; for although the medullary rays and the
circular mode of deposition both tend to a less difficult
cleavage of the wood, they yet bind the parts very closely
to each other.</p>

<p>The explanation of the occurrence of distinct zones of
wood is, that each zone is the produce of one year, and
that in our climate, more so than in tropical climates, the
period of growth of wood ceases for many months between
the seasons, and this induces a distinction in appearance
between the last wood of a former, and the first wood of a
succeeding year. This distinction is maintained throughout
each year, and throughout a long series of years.</p>

<p>The enclosure of zone within zone, is owing to the
mode in which the wood is produced, and the position in
which it is deposited. Wood is formed by the leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
during the growing season, and passes down towards the
root between the bark and the wood of the previous year;
and, as the leaves more or less surround the whole stem,
the new layer at length completes a zone, and perfectly
encloses the wood of all former years. This is the explanation
of the term exogenous, which is derived from
two words signifying to grow, outwardly, for the stem
increases in thickness by successive layers on the outer
side of the previously formed wood.</p>

<p>The thickness of the zone for the year is rarely equal
around the whole circumference of the stem, and this is
due to the lesser abundance of leaves on the branches of
one side than on the other, or to the prevalence of winds,
or some other physical cause, acting in that direction in
opposition to the growing process. It should be observed
that there is not in timber any appearance of a gradual
change from alburnum to perfect wood. On the contrary,
in all cases the division is most decided; one concentric
layer being perfect wood, and the next in succession sap-wood.</p>

<p>The age of trees has been inferred, when a section of
the whole stem could be examined, by counting the
number of rings of wood which have been deposited
around the pith. In tropical countries, however, this
method cannot be always relied upon.</p>

<p>Woods are variable in quality according to the nature
of the climate, and of the soil, as also in a considerable
degree to the aspect in which they are situated. Trees
grown slowly in open, dry, and exposed situations are
more fine and close in their annual rings, and more substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and durable, than those which are grown in close
and shady forests, or rapidly reared in moist or sappy
places, the latter being soft and broad in their rings, and
very subject to decay; and their pith is not always quite
in the centre, for the layers are variable also.</p>

<p>The waggon maker takes care to combine toughness
and durability by selecting his wood from trees of second
growth, or from trees of first growth that from infancy
have stood alone, or far apart. If the soft wood trees have
stood alone, and are very large (as is often the case with
some of the pines), and most of the branches are near the
top, the wood near the base of the trunk is sometimes
found to be <i>shaky</i>. This defect is produced by the action
of heavy winds on the top of the tree, which wrenches or
twists the butt, and thus cleaves apart the fibres of the
wood. If the main-top (<i>couronnement</i>, of French writers)
of a tree dies while the tree is yet standing, it indicates
that water has found its way into the trunk, and that the
tree is in a state of decay.</p>

<p>The fir which grows on very dry marl, forms very
narrow yearly rings; if on rich or damp marl, they are
wide; and when on wet soil, they are again smaller. The
common fir on moor soil, has even smaller yearly rings
than if on dry sand or marl. From this it is evident
that too wet or too dry a soil is not suitable for this tree.</p>

<p>The alder and the willow grow best on wet soil, and
thrive but poorly when standing dry.</p>

<p>The weight of wood is of great importance, because its
hardness, resistance, and its heating power, as well as
other valuable properties, are all more or less depending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
upon it. In the first place, we must consider that even
wood which has been forested very light will become
heavy, when put for some time into water, but in such
timbers the sap is already given to dissolution. If the
fibre were the only substance in the wood, then the specific
weight would depend upon the number of pores contained
in its body; the pores are, however, filled with a substance
such as resin, die, &amp;c. Some years since, when the Indian
railways were being formed, the native wood-cutters were
so well aware of the above-mentioned fact, that they used
to cut down the soft and inferior woods in the forests; soak
them in water for a certain time; and then endeavour to
pass them to the railway contractors as sound, heavy, and
good railway sleepers, and the latter, not being acquainted
with the Indian woods, were, at first, often deceived.</p>

<p>The hardest, and heaviest woods come from the hotter
climates; the only exception is the pine, which thrives considerably
better, and furnishes heavier timber, when it has
grown in colder regions, or upon high mountains.</p>

<p>Trees grown on northern slopes furnish lighter timber
than if grown on southern or western. The soil has great
influence upon the width of the yearly rings, and from
this we are able to come to a conclusion in regard to the
specific weight. In the fir and larch trees the wood is
heaviest when their rings are smallest.</p>

<p>The difference in the strength of timber between the
south and the north side is attributable to the grain being
closer on the north side, as the sap does not rise in the
same proportion as upon the south. In forest-grown
wood the difference is almost imperceptible, as the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
cannot act upon the trunk of the tree; in open-grown
timber, the difference is really perceptible. It is well
known that all woods do not lose strength by being open
grown, or, in other words, that the south side is not always
weaker than the north; that theory only applies to the
coniferæ species. In ash it is the opposite, as the south
side is the strongest. In soft-wooded trees, as the acer
species, the difference is not perceptible, as the annual
rings, and the intervening cellular tissues, are so close
akin as to render the wood so compact in its grain that
there is no difference in its strength. The coniferæ
species, or the pines, are the only classes of woods that
are stronger on the north side than on the south: it is
well known that the difference originates in the wood
being more open in the grain on the south side than on
the north.</p>

<p>An influence upon the specific weight is exercised by
the resin, and the die, which are contained in the interior
of the wood. On level dry ground, or deep sandy soil,
we find the fir beautifully red inside; but when we look
at it on lias soil, it shows broad yearly rings, and hardly
any colour at all. The larch tree, again, in such soil,
develops itself well with a rich colour. The cause for
these appearances must therefore rest with the chemical
condition of the soil, and its effect upon the individuality
of the fir: it is probably the nature of the soil that causes
the difference of character between Honduras and Spanish
mahogany; Honduras being full of black specks, and
Spanish of minute white particles, as if it had been
rubbed over with chalk. Oaks generally furnish good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
timber when grown slowly in dry ground, whilst those
from wet soil appear comparatively spongy; similar results
are obtained with other trees.</p>

<p>Many persons constantly employed on wood are of
opinion that it becomes harder if it is worked or barked
whilst green.</p>

<p>It is not safe to condemn timber, merely because long
cracks are visible on the surface. Such openings are
frequently only superficial, and do not penetrate deeply
into the wood: in such cases it is very little weakened
thereby. It is difficult to obtain timber of large scantling
without some defects of this kind, but care should be
taken to ascertain if they are of a serious nature.</p>

<p>Trees arrive at an age when their wood becomes ripe,
and then they are fit for felling; but as upon the proper
method and time for doing this, the prevention of dry rot
frequently hinges, a separate chapter is devoted to this
part of the subject.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE GRADUAL RISE AND DEVELOPMENT OF
DRY ROT.</span></h2>

<p>The opinion generally received has drawn a line of discrimination
between the decay accompanied by a vegetable
spreading on the surface of the timber, and that which is
effected by an animal existing within it, which decay is
frequently denominated the worm in timber; but as each
is equally entitled to the dreaded appellation, they might
more justly be distinguished as the animal and vegetable
rot.</p>

<p>The dry rot in timber derives its name from the effect
produced, and not from the cause: it is so called in opposition
to the wet rot, which is properly denominated, as
this exists only in damp situations, and is applied to the
decomposition which takes place in timber containing sap,
and exposed to moisture: but although the dry rot is
usually generated in moisture, in some cases it will flourish
independent of extraneous humidity. Dry rot differs
from wet rot in this respect, that the former takes place
only when the wood is dead, whereas the latter may begin
when the tree is standing.</p>

<p>Wet rots are composed of porous fibre running from the
rot into the trunk of the tree. This rot is of a brown
colour, and has an offensive smell. The evil is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
found with white spots, the latter of watery substance:
when it has yellow flames, it is very dangerous.</p>

<p>A large quantity of the vegetable kingdom consists
of plants differing totally from the flowering plants in
general structure, having no flowers and producing no
seed properly so called, but propagating by means of
minute cellular bodies, called <i>spores</i>. These highly organized
vegetables are known to botanists as <i>Cryptogamia</i>.
Fungi are plants in which the fructifying organs are so
minute, that without the aid of a powerful microscope
they cannot be detected. To the naked eye, the fine dust
ejected from the plant is the only token of reproduction;
this dust, however, is not truly seed, for the word seed
supposes the existence of an embryo, and there is no such
thing in the reproductive bodies of fungi. The correct
terms are <i>spores</i>, when the seeds are not in a case; <i>sporidia</i>
when enclosed in cases. The spores or sporidia are placed
in or upon the receptacle, which is of very various forms
and kinds, but how different soever these may be, it is the
essential part of the fungus, and in many cases constitutes
the entire plant. That portion of the receptacle in which
the reproductive bodies are imbedded is called the
<i>hymenium</i>: it is either external, as in the Agaric, where
it forms gills; or included, as in the puff-balls. The
<i>pileus</i> of fungi is the entire head of the plant, not a
mere head covering.</p>

<p>Some naturalists have insisted upon the spontaneous
production of fungi, while others maintain that they are
produced by seed, which is taken up and supported in the
air until a soil proper for its nourishment is presented, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
which being deposited it springs up of various appearances
according to the principle of the seed, and the nature of
the recipient.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to give a logical definition of
what constitutes a fungus. It is not always easy with a
cursory observation under the microscope, to determine
whether some appearances are produced by fungi, insects,
or organic disease; experience is the safest guide, and
until we acquire that we shall occasionally fail.</p>

<p>In the ‘Index Fungorum Britannicorum,’ 2479 species
of British fungi are enumerated: any detailed account of
the arrangement of this extensive family of plants, or
of the character of even its principal sections would be
impossible within the limits of this volume; all that can
be attempted will be a general description of the fungi
causing dry rot.</p>

<p>If dry rot shows itself in a damp closet or pantry, the
inside of the china or delf lying there will be coated
with a mould, or a fine powder like brick-dust. This
excessively fine powder is no other than unaccountable
myriads of the reproductive spores or <i>seeds</i> of the fungus;
they are red in colour, and are produced on the surface
of the fungus in millions. Certain privileged cells on the
face of the fungus are furnished each with four minute
points at their apex, each four bearing a single brick-red,
egg-shaped spore; so that the fruit is spread over the
surface of the fungus in groups of fours. To see the
form of these spores the highest powers of the microscope
are required, and then they can only be viewed as transparent
objects. If these excessively minute bodies be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
allowed to fall on wet flannel, damp blotting-paper, or
wet wood, they immediately germinate and proceed to
reproduce the parent fungus. The red skin of the spores
cracks at both ends, and fine mycelial filaments are sent
out: this is the “mould,” spawn, or mycelium from
which the new fungus (under favourable conditions of continued
moisture) appears.</p>

<p>It matters little where we go: everywhere we are
surrounded with life. The air is crowded with birds and
insects; the waters are peopled with innumerable forms,
and even the rocks are blackened with countless mussels
and barnacles. If we pluck a flower, in its bosom we see
many a charming insect. If we pick up a fallen leaf,
there is probably the trace of an insect larvæ hidden in
its tissue. The drop of dew upon this leaf will probably
contain its animals, visible under the microscope. The
very mould which covers our cheese, our bread, our jam,
or our ink, and disfigures our damp walls, is nothing but
a collection of plants.</p>

<p>The starting point of life is a single cell-that is to say
a microscopic sac filled with liquid and granules, and
having within it a nucleus, or smaller sac. From this
starting point of a single cell, this is the course taken:
the cell divides itself into two, the two become four, the
four eight, and so on, till a mass of cells is formed.</p>

<p>The researches of Pasteur show that atmospheric dust
is filled with minute germs of various species of animals
and plants, ready to develop as soon as they fall into a
congenial locality. He concludes that all fermentation is
caused by the germination of such infinitesimal spores.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
That they elude observation does not seem strange, when
we consider that some infusoria are only ⅟240000 of an
inch in length.</p>

<p>It is ascertained that fungi produce seed which contains
the properties of germination; and that vegetable corruption
is suited to effect it. When we contemplate the
fineness and volatility of the germs, the hypothesis will
not appear unreasonable that they are conveyed by the
rains into the earth, and are absorbed by vegetables;
that with the sap they are disseminated throughout the
whole body, and begin to germinate as soon as the
vegetable has proceeded to corruption. Whatever, therefore,
may be the appearance or situation of the fungus
producing the dry rot, or from whatever substance it
originates, that substance must be in a corrupt state.</p>

<p>Fungi result from, or are attendant on, vegetable corruption,
assisted by an adequate proportion of heat and
moisture. The sap, or principle of vegetation, brought
into activity, is, according to the ‘Quarterly Review,’
No. 15, the cause of dry rot, in as far as it is favourable
to the growth of fungi, as it would seem to be when in a
state of fermentation.</p>

<p>Vegetable corruption invariably presupposes fermentation.</p>

<p>Fermentation is a state of vegetable matter, the component
parts of which have acquired sufficient force to
produce an intestinal motion, by which the earthy saline,
the oily and aqueous particles therein contained, exert
their several peculiar attractive and repulsive powers,
forming new combinations, which at first change, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
length altogether destroy the texture of the substance
they formerly composed.</p>

<p>There are two things essential towards creating and supporting
the intestinal motion, namely, heat and humidity;
for without heat, the air, which is supposed to be the
cohesive principle of all bodies, cannot be so rarefied as to
resume its elasticity; and without humidity there can be
no intestinal motion.</p>

<p>According to Baron Liebig, the decay of wood takes
place in the three following modes:&mdash;First, oxygen in the
atmosphere combines with the hydrogen in the fibre, and
the oxygen unites with the portion of carbon of the fibre,
and evaporates as carbonic acid: this process is called
decomposition. Second, we have to notice the actual decay
of wood which takes place when it is brought in contact
with rotting substances; and the third process is called
putrefaction. This is stated by Liebig to arise from the
inner decomposition of the wood in itself: it loses its
carbon, forms carbonic acid gas, and the fibre, under the
influence of the latter, is changed into white dust.</p>

<p>The fungus occasioning the dry rot is of various appearances,
which differ according to the situation in which it
exists. In the earth, it is fibrous and perfectly white,
ramifying in the form of roots; passing through substances
from the external surface, it somewhat differs
from that form; here it separates into innumerable small
branches.</p>

<p>Mr. McWilliam observes, “If the fungi proceed from
the slime in the fissures of the earth, they are generally
very ramous, having round fibres shooting in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
direction. If they arise from the roots of trees, their first
appearance is something like hoar frost; but they soon
assume the mushroom shape.”</p>

<p>Hence it appears that we frequently build on spots of
ground which contain the fundamental principle of the
disease, and thus we are sometimes foiled in our endeavours
to destroy the fungus by the admission of air. In
this case the disease may be encouraged by the application
of air as a remedy. When workmen are employed
in buildings which contain dry rot, and when they are
working on ground which contains the symptoms of this
disease, their health is often affected. A London builder
informs us, that a few years since, while building some
houses at Hampstead his men were never well: he afterwards
ascertained that the ground was affected with rot,
and that within one year after the house was erected, all
the basement floor was in a state of premature decay.
Sir Robert Smirke, architect, remarked in 1835, that he
had noticed “there are certain situations in which dry rot
prevails remarkably.”</p>

<p>The fungus protruded in a very damp situation is fibrous,
of moderate thickness, feels fleshy. From the spot whence
it arises it extends equally around, wholly covering the
area of a circle. This form would possibly continue in
whatever situation it might vegetate, if the air had no
motion, and every part of the substance on which it grew
were equally supplied with a matter proper to encourage
the expansion. The surface of this fungus is pursed, and
of various colours, the centre is of a dusky brown, mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with green, graduated into a red, which degenerates into
yellow, and terminates in white.</p>

<p>One of the most formidable of the tribe of fungi is the
<i>Merulius lachrymans</i> (often called <i>the</i> Dry Rot) of which
the following description is given by Dr. Greville: “Whole
plant generally resupinate, soft, tender, at first very light,
cottony, and white. When the veins appear, they are of a
fine yellow, orange, or reddish brown, forming irregular
folds, most frequently so arranged as to have the appearance
of pores, but never anything like tubes, <i>and distilling,
when perfect, drops of water</i>.” Hence the term <i>lachrymans</i>,
from <i>lacrymo</i>, Lat., I weep: the <i>Merulius lachrymans</i> is
often dripping with moisture, as if weeping in regret for
the havoc it has made. In the genus <i>Merulius</i>, the texture
is soft and waxy, and the hymenium is disposed in porous
or wavy toothed folds. Berkeley, in his ‘Fungology,’
gives the following description, which is similar to Dr.
Greville’s: “Large, fleshy but spongy, moist, ferruginous
yellow, arachnoid and velvety beneath; margin tomentose,
white; folds ample, porous, and gyroso-dentate.” The
<i>Merulius</i> is found in cellars and hollow trees, sometimes
several feet in width, and is the main cause of dry rot.</p>

<p>Another formidable fungi, which attacks oak in ships,
is the <i>Polyporus hybridus</i> (the dry rot of our oak-built
vessels). It is thus described by Berkeley: “White,
mycelium thick, forming a dense membrane, or creeping
branched strings, hymenium breaking up into areæ, pores
long, slender, minute.”</p>

<p>From the slow progress dry rot makes in damp situations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
it appears that excessive damps are inimical to the
fungus, for its growth is more rapid in proportion as the
situation is less damp, until arrived at that certain degree
of moisture which is suited both to its production and
vegetation. When further extended to dry situations, its
effects are considerably more destructive to the timber on
which it subsists: here it is very fibrous, and in part
covered with a light brown membrane, perfectly soft and
smooth. It is often of much greater magnitude, projecting
from the timber in a white spongeous excrescence, on the
surfaces of which a profuse humidity is frequently observed:
at other times, it consists only of a fibrous and thin-coated
web irregularly on the surface of the wood. Excrescences
of a fungiform appearance are often protruded amidst those
already described, and are evidences of a very corrupt
matter peculiar to the spots whence they spring. According
to the situation and matter in which they are produced,
they are dry and tough, or wet, soft, and fleshy, sometimes
arising in several fungiforms, each above the other, without
any distinction of stem; and when the matter is differently
corrupted, it not unfrequently generates the small acrid
mushroom.</p>

<p>Mr. McWilliam observes, “The fungi arising from oak
timbers are generally in clusters of from three to ten or
twelve; while those from fir timber are mostly in single
plants: and these will continue to succeed each other
until the wood is quite exhausted.”</p>

<p>Damp is not only a cause of decay, but is essential to
it; while, on the other hand, absolute wet, especially at a
low temperature, prevents it. In ships this has been particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
remarked, for that part of the hold of a ship
which is constantly washed by the bilge-water is never
affected with dry rot. Neither is that side of the planking
of a ship’s bottom which is next the water found in a
state of decay, even when the inside is quite rotten, unless
the rot has penetrated quite through the inside.</p>

<p>It matters little whether wet is applied to timber before
or after the erection of a building. Timber cannot resist
the effect of what must arise in either case; viz. heat and
moisture, producing putrid fermentation; for instance, in
basement stories with damp under them, dry timber is but
little better than wet, for if it is dry it will soon be wet;
decay will only be delayed so long as the timbers are
absorbing sufficient moisture, therefore every situation
that admits moisture is the destruction of timber.</p>

<p>In a constancy and equality of temperature timber will
endure for ages. Sir Christopher Wren, in his letter to
the Bishop of Rochester, inserted in Wadman’s ‘History
of Westminster Abbey,’ notices “That Venice and
Amsterdam being both founded on wooden piles immersed
in water, would fall if the constancy of the situation of
those piles in the same element and temperature did not
prevent the timber from rotting.” Nothing is more
destructive to woodwork than <i>partial leaks</i>, for if it be
kept <i>always wet</i> or <i>always dry</i>, its duration is of long continuance.
It is recorded that a pile was drawn up sound
from a bridge on the Danube, that parted the Austrian
and Turkish dominions, which had been under water 1500
years.</p>

<p>The writer of an article on the decay of wood, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
‘Encyclopædia Britannica,’ 1855, observes, “If a post of
wood be driven into the ground, the decay will commence
at the surface of the ground; if driven into the earth
through water, the decay will commence at the surface of
the water; if used as a beam let into a damp wall, rot
will commence just where the wood enters the wall.”</p>

<p>Humboldt observes in his ‘Cosmos,’ with reference to
damp and damp rooms, that anyone can ascertain whether
a room is damp or not, by placing a weighed quantity of
fresh lime in an open vessel in the room, and leaving it
there for twenty-four hours, carefully closing the windows
and doors. At the end of the twenty-four hours the lime
should be reweighed, and if the increase exceeds one per
cent. of the original weight, it is not safe to live in the room.</p>

<p>Decay of timber will arise from the effects of continued
dryness or continued wetness, under certain conditions; or
it may also arise from the effect of alternate dryness and
moisture, or continued moisture with heat.</p>

<p>At one time dry rot appears to have made great havoc
amongst the wooden ships of the British Navy. In the
Memoirs of Pepys, who was Secretary to the Admiralty
during the reigns of Charles II. and James II., reference
is made to a Commission which was appointed to inquire
into the state of the navy, and from which it appears that
thirty ships, called new ships, “for want of proper care
and attention, had toadstools growing in their holds as big
as one’s fists, and were in so complete a state of decay,
that some of the planks had dropped from their sides.”</p>

<p>In the ‘European Magazine’ for December, 1811, it is
stated that, “about 1798, there was, at Woolwich, a ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in so bad a state that the deck sunk with a man’s weight,
and the orange and brown coloured fungi were hanging,
in the shape of inverted cones, from deck to deck.”</p>

<p>Mr. William Chapman, in his ‘Preservation of Timber
from Premature Decay,’ &amp;c., gives several instances of the
rapid decay of the ships of the Royal Navy, about the
commencement of the present century. He mentions
three ships of 74 guns each, decayed in five years; three
of 74 guns each, decayed in seven years; and one of 100
guns, decayed in six years. Mr. Pering, also, in his ‘Brief
Enquiry into the Causes of Premature Decay,’ &amp;c., says
that ships of war are useless in five or six years; and he
estimates the average duration to be eight years, and that
the cost of the hull alone of a three-decker was nearly
100,000<i>l.</i> Mr. Pering was formerly at the dockyard,
Plymouth, and therefore a good authority, if he availed
himself of the opportunities of studying the subject. He
has stated that he has seen fungi growing so strong
betwixt the timbers in a man-of-war, as to force a plank
from the ship’s side half an inch.</p>

<p>No doubt a great deal of this decay was attributable to
the use of unseasoned timber, and defective ventilation;
but there is too much reason to believe that it was principally
owing to the introduction of an inferior species of
oak (<i>Quercus sessiliflora</i>) into the naval dockyards, where,
we imagine, the distinction was not even suspected. The
true old English oak (<i>Quercus robur</i>) affords a close-grained,
firm, solid timber, rarely subject to rot; the other
is more loose and sappy, very liable to rot, and not half
so durable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>One cause of the decay of wood in ships is the use of
wooden treenails. A treenail is a piece of cleft wood
(made round), from 1 foot to 3 feet 6 inches in length
and 1½ inch in diameter. As the treenails are also
made to drive easy, they never fill the holes they are
driven into; consequently, if ever it admits water at the
outer end, which, from shrinking, it is liable to do, that
water immediately gets into the middle of the plank, and
thereby forms a natural vehicle for the conveyance of
water. The treenail is also the second thing which
decays in a ship, the first, generally, being the oakum.
Should any part of the plank or timbers of a ship be in an
incipient state of decay, and a treenail come in contact
with it, the decay immediately increases, while every
treenail shares the same fate, and the natural consequence
is, the ship is soon left without a fastening. Treenails in
a warm country are sure to shrink and admit water.</p>

<p>Mr. Fincham, formerly Principal Builder in Her
Majesty’s dockyard, Chatham, considers that the destruction
of timber by the decay commonly known as dry rot,
cannot occur unless air, (?) moisture, and heat are all
present, and that the entire exclusion of any of the three
stays the mischief. By way of experiment, he bored a
hole in one of the timbers of an old ship built of oak,
whose wood was at the time perfectly sound; the admission
of air, the third element, to the central part of the
wood (the two others being to a certain degree present)
caused the hole to be filled up in the course of twenty-four
hours with mouldiness, which very speedily became so
compact as to admit of being withdrawn like a stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The confinement of timber under most circumstances is
attended with the worst consequences, yet a partial ventilation
tends to fan the flame of decay.</p>

<p>The admission of air has long been considered the only
means of destroying the fungus, but as it has frequently
proved ineffectual, it must not be always taken as a certain
remedy. If dry air be properly admitted, in a quantity
adequate to absorb the moisture, it will necessarily exhaust
and destroy the fungus; but care should be taken
lest the air should be conveyed into other parts of the
building, for, after disengaging itself from the fungus
over which it has passed, it carries with it innumerable
seeds of the disease, and destroys everything which offers
a bar to its progress. Air, in passing through damps,
will partake of their humidity; it therefore soon becomes
inadequate to the task for which it is designed. Owing
to this circumstance, air has been frequently admitted into
the affected parts of a building without any ultimate
success; too often, instead of injuring the fungus, it has
considerably assisted its vegetation, and infected with the
disease other parts of the building, which would otherwise
probably have remained without injury. The timber,
which is in a state of decomposition by an intestinal
decay, is little affected by the application of air, as this
cannot penetrate the surrounding spongeous rottenness
which generally forms the exterior of such timber, and
protects the action which the humid particles have
acquired in the exterior: as the extent and progress of
the disease is therefore necessarily concealed, it is difficult
to ascertain correctly the effect produced by the admission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of dry air. Under these circumstances of necessity and
danger, it will require considerable skill to effect the
purpose without increasing the disease, and, as each case
has its own peculiar characteristics, it is necessary before
one attempts to admit air as a remedy, to previously estimate
the destructive consequences which may result from
so doing, and ascertain whether it will be injurious or
beneficial to the building. The joists of the houses built
by our ancestors last almost for ever, because they are in
contact with an air which is continually changing. Now,
on the contrary, we foolishly enclose them between a
ceiling of plaster (always very damp to begin with) and
a floor; they frequently decay, and then cause the most
serious disasters, of which it is impossible to be forewarned.</p>

<p>Damp, combined with warmth, is as a destroying agent,
still more active than simple damp alone&mdash;the heat being
understood as insufficient to carry off the moisture by
evaporation; and the higher the temperature with a corresponding
degree of moisture, the more rapid the decay.
If the temperature to which wood is exposed, whilst any
sap remains in it, is too elevated, the vegetable fluids
ferment; the tenacity is diminished, and when the action
is carried to its full extent, the wood quickly becomes
affected by the dry rot. Exposure to the atmosphere
in positions where rain can lodge in quantity, contact
with the ground, and application in damp situations
deprived of air, will render wood liable to the wet rot;
and however well seasoned it may have been previously
to being brought within the influence of any of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
causes, it will infallibly suffer. Air should therefore have
free access to the wood in every direction:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>… “for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests
round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the
house.”&mdash;1 Kings vi. 6.</p>

</div>

<p>Rondelet says, “The woodwork of the church of St.
Paul, outside the city walls, which was destroyed by fire
in 1823, was erected as far back as the fifth century.”
Although the atmosphere surrounding the framework was
often at once warm and damp, yet it was never stagnant.
It should be remembered that 500 people in a church
during two hours give off fifteen gallons of water into the
air, which, if not carried away, saturates everything in
the building after it has been breathed over and over
again in conjunction with the impurities it contains collected
from each individual.</p>

<p>Fever, scrofula, and consumption arise in many instances
from defective ventilation.</p>

<p>The signs of decay in timber are, as has been stated,
fungi. Some of them now and then are microscopic, and
owe their existence to the sporules deposited on the
surface; while fermentation, generated by prolonged contact
with warm, damp, and stagnant air, is as a soil where
seeds sow and nourish themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. McWilliam, in his work on dry rot, states that if
the temperature be very low or very high, the effects are
the same with respect to the growth of fungi. At 80° dry
rot will proceed rapidly, at 90° its progress is more slow;
at 100° it is slower still, and from 110° to 120° it will in
general be arrested. It will proceed fast at 50°; it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
be generated at 40°; its progress will be slow at 36°; and
is arrested at 32°, yet it will return if the temperature is
raised to 50°.</p>

<p>Dry rot externally first makes its appearance as a
mildew, or rather a delicate white vegetation, that looks
like such. The next step is a collecting together of the
fibres of the vegetation into a more decided form, somewhat
like hoar frost; after which it speedily assumes the
leathery, compact character of the fungus, forming into
leaves, spreading rapidly in all directions, and over all
materials, and frequently ascending the walls to a considerable
height, the colour variable&mdash;white, greyish white,
and violet, light or decided brown, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the section of a piece of wood attacked by dry rot
a microscope reveals minute white threads spreading and
ramifying throughout its substance; these interlace and
become matted together into a white cottony texture,
resembling lint, which effuses itself over the surface of
the timber; then in the centre of each considerable mass
a gelatinous substance forms, which becomes gradually of
a yellow, tawny hue, and a wrinkled, sinuated porous consistence,
shedding a red powder (the spores) upon a white
down; this is the resupinate pileus, the hymenium being
upwards, of <i>Merulius lachrymans</i>, in its perfect and
matured state. Long before it attains to this, the whole
interior of the wood on which it is situated has perished;
the sap vessels being gradually filled by the cottony
filaments of the fungus; no sooner do these appear
externally than examination proves that the apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
solid beam may be crumbled to dust between the fingers;
tenacity and weight are annihilated.</p>

<p>Dr. Haller says that seven parts in eight of a fungus in
full vegetation are found by analysis to be completely
aqueous.</p>

<p>The strength of fungi is proportionate to the strength
of the timber the cohesive powers and nutritive juices of
which they absorb; and according to the food they receive
so they are varied and modified in different ways, and
are not always alike. Different stages of corruption produce
food of different qualities, and hence many of the
different appearances of fungi. One takes the process of
corruption up where another leaves it off, and carries it
forward and farther forward to positive putrefaction.</p>

<p>The forms which fungi assume are extremely diversified;
in some instances we have a distinct stem supporting a
cap, and looking somewhat like a parasol; in others the
stem is entirely absent, and the cap is attached either by
its margin, and is said to be <i>dimidiate</i>, or by its back, or
that which is more commonly its upper surface, when it is
called <i>resupinate</i>. In some species the form is that of a
cup, in others of a goblet, a saucer, an ear, a bird’s nest, a
horn, a bunch of coral, a ball, a button, a rosette, a lump
of jelly, or a piece of velvet.</p>

<p>Decomposition takes place without fungus where the
timber and the situation are always moist, as in a
close-boarded kitchen floor, where it is always dry, or
very nearly so, and where it is alternately wet and dry,
cold and hot. When the decomposition is affected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
very little moisture, and no fungus, the admission of air
will generally prevent further contamination; but where
there is abundance of moisture, rottenness, and fungus, a
small quantity of air will hasten the destruction of the
building.</p>

<p>In timber which has been only superficially seasoned
this disease is produced internally, and has been known to
convert the entire substance of a beam, excepting only
the external inch or two of thickness to which the
seasoning had penetrated, into a fine, white, and threadlike
vegetation, uniting in a thick fungous coat at the
ends, the semblance being that of a perfectly sound beam.
In this internal rot a spongy fungous substance is formed
between the fibres. This has often been observed in large
girders of yellow fir, which have appeared sound on the
outside, but by removing some of the binding joists have
been found completely rotten at the heart. An instance
of this kind occurred at Kenwood (the seat of the Earl of
Mansfield) in 1815. Major Jones, R.E., states that on one
occasion he was called upon to report on the state of a
building in Malta; that the timbers had every external
appearance of being sound, but on being bored with an
auger they were found internally in a total state of decay.
It is on this account that the practice of sawing and
bolting beams is recommended, for when timber is large
enough to be laid open in the centre this part is laid open
to season; so that when a tree is large enough to be cut
through to make two or more beams, decomposition is
impeded.</p>

<p>The first symptoms of rottenness in timber are swelling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
discoloration, and mouldiness, accompanied with a musty
smell; in its greater advance the fibres are found to
shrink lengthways and break, presenting many deep
fissures across the wood; the fibres crumble readily to a
fine snuff-like powder, but retain, when undisturbed, much
of their natural appearance.</p>

<p>In whatever way boughs are removed from trees, the
effect of their removal is, however, very frequently to
produce a rotting of the inner wood, which indicates
itself externally by a sudden abnormal swelling of the
trunk a little above the root; sometimes the trunk
becomes hollow at the part affected, and this particular
description of rot will almost invariably be found to exist
in those trees whose roots are much exposed. The rot
itself is either of a red, black, or white colour in the
timber when felled, and when either of the two last-named
colours prevail, it will be found that the decay
does not extend very far into the tree; but if, on the
contrary, the colour of the parts most visibly affected
should be decidedly red, the wood should be rejected for
any building purposes. Sometimes small brown spots,
indicative of a commencement of decay, may be observed
near the butt or root end of trees, and though they do
not appear to be connected with any serious immediate
danger to the durability of the wood, it is advisable to
employ the material so affected only in positions where it
would not be confined in anything like a close, damp
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Great hesitation may be admitted as to the use of
timber which presents large bands of what are supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to be indefinitely-marked annual growth, because the
existence of zones of wood so affected may be considered
to indicate that the tree was not in a healthy state when
they were formed, and that the wood then secreted lacked
some of the elements required for its durability, upon being
subsequently exposed to the ordinary causes of decay.</p>

<p>In many cases when timber trees are cut down and
converted for use, it is found that at the junction of some
of the minor branches with the main stem, the roots, as it
were, of the branches traverse the surface wood in the
form of knots, and that they often assume a commencement
of decay, which in the course of time will extend to
the wood around them. This decay seems to have arisen
in the majority of cases from the sudden disruption of
the branch close to its roots, with an irregular fracture,
and with such depressions below the surface as to allow
the sap to accumulate, or atmospheric moisture to lodge in
them. A decomposition of the sap takes place&mdash;in fact,
a wound is made in the tree-and what are called “druxy
knots” are thus formed, which have a contagious action
on the healthy wood near them.</p>

<p>There is this particular danger about the dry rot; viz.
that the germs of the fungi producing it are carried easily,
and in all directions, in a building wherein it once displays
itself, without necessity for actual contact between the
affected or the sound wood; whereas the communication
of the disease resulting from the putrefactive fermentation,
or the wet rot, only takes place by actual contact.</p>

<img src="images/illus1.jpg" width="430" height="700" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><i>Timber Beams,&mdash;rotten at the heart.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Before dry rot has time to destroy the principal timbers
in a building, it penetrates behind the skirtings, dadoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and wainscotings, drawing in the edges of the boards, and
splitting them both horizontally and vertically. When
the fungus is taken off, they exhibit an appearance similar
both in back and front to wood which has been charred; a
light pressure with the hand will break them asunder,
even though affected with the rot but a short time; and
in taking down the wainscot, the fibrous and thin-coated
fungus will generally be seen closely attached to the
decayed wood. In timber of moderate length the fungus
becomes larger and more destructive, in consequence of
the matter congenial to its growth affording a more
plentiful supply.</p>

<p>It is a great characteristic of fungi in general that they
are very rapid in growth, and rapid in decay. In a night
a puff-ball will grow prodigiously, and in the same short
period a mass of paste may be covered with mould. In a
few hours a gelatinous mass of <i>Reticularia</i> will pass into
a bladder of dust, or a <i>Coprinus</i> will be dripping into
decay. Many instances have been recorded of the rapidity
of growth in fungi; it may also be accepted as an axiom
that they are in many instances equally as rapid in decay.</p>

<p>In considering the liability of any particular description
of foreign timber to take the dry rot, attention must
be paid to the circumstances under which it is imported.
Sometimes the timber is a long while coming here, whilst
at other times it is imported in a very short period. The
length of time consumed in the voyage has a great deal
to do with its likelihood of taking the rot: it may have a
very favourable passage, or a very wet one, and the ship is
frequently, in some degree, affected with the disease. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
perhaps begins in the ship, and it may often be seen
between the timber or deals, when it will impregnate the
wood to a great depth. Whether it is inherent in the
timber or not, of this we may be certain, that where there
is a fetid atmosphere it is sure to grow. Canadian yellow
wood pine timber is more subject to rot than Baltic or
Canadian red wood timber, although the latter will
sometimes decay in four or five years. Turpentine is a
preventive against dry rot, and Canadian timber is sometimes
largely impregnated with it, especially the red wood
timber; the yellow wood is very subject to dry rot. Very
few cargoes of timber in the log arrive from Canada in
which in one part or other of nearly every log you will
not see a beginning of the vegetation of the rot. Sometimes
it will show itself only by a few reddish, discoloured
spots, which, when scratched by the finger nail to the
extent of each spot, it will be seen that the texture of
the timber to some little depth is destroyed, and will be
reduced to powder; and on these spots a white fibre may
generally be seen growing. If the timber has been
shipped in a dry condition, and the voyage has been a
short one, there may be a few logs without a spot; but
generally speaking very few cargoes arrive from Canada
in which there are many logs of timber not affected. But
if the cargo has been shipped in a wet condition, and the
voyage has been a long one, then a white fibre will be
seen growing over nearly every part of the surface of
every log; and in cargoes that have been so shipped, all
the logs of yellow pine, red pine, and of oak, are generally
more or less affected on the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly every deal of yellow pine that has been shipped
in Canada in a wet state, when it arrives here is also
covered over with a network of little white fibres, which
are the dry rot in its incipient state. There is no cargo,
even that which is shipped in tolerably dry condition, in
which, upon its arriving here, may not be found some
deals, with the fungus beginning to vegetate on their
surface. If they are deals that have been floated down
the rivers of America or Canada, and shipped in a wet
state, on their arrival here they are so covered with this
network of the fungus, that force is often necessary to
separate one deal from another, so strongly does the
fungus occasion them to adhere. They grow together
again, as it were, after quitting the ship, while lying in
the barges, before being landed. Accordingly, if a cargo
has arrived in a wet condition, or late in the year, or if
the rain falls on the deals before they are landed, and
they are then piled in the way in which Norwegian and
Swedish deals are piled, that is, flatways, in six months
time, or even less, the whole pile of deals become deeply
affected with rot; so that, whenever a flat surface of one
deal is upon the flat surface of another, the rot penetrates
to the depth of ⅛ of an inch. Its progress is then arrested
by repiling the deals during very dry weather, and by
sweeping the surface of each deal before it is repiled: but
the best way is to pile the deals in the first instance upon
their edges; by which means the air circulates freely
around them, the growth of the fungus is arrested, and
the necessity of repiling them prevented. If the ship is
built of good, sound, and well-seasoned oak, the rot would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
perhaps not affect it, but in order to prevent its doing so,
the precaution is usually taken to scrape the surface as
soon as the hold is clear of the cargo of timber. Were
the cargo not cleared, and the hold not ventilated, a ship
that was permanently exposed to this fungus would, no
doubt, be affected. It is easy, however, to prevent its
extending by washing the hold with any desiccating
solution.</p>

<p>Anyone who wishes to know how timber is occasionally
shipped to this country should read the report of a trial,
in the ‘Times,’ 22nd Feb., 1875 (Harrison <i>v.</i> Willis),
relative to a cargo of pitch pine shipped from Sapelo, in
the Isthmus of Darien, for Liverpool. This cargo, however,
never arrived at Liverpool: it was lost at sea.</p>

<p>The motto of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights
is, “Within the ark, safe for ever.” We suggest it should
be altered to, “Within the ark <i>which is free from dry rot</i>,
safe for ever.”</p>

<p>There are two descriptions of European deals very
liable to take the dry rot; viz. yellow Petersburgh deals,
and yellow and white battens, from Dram, in Norway.
When Dram battens, which have been lying a long time
in bond in this country, have not been repiled in time,
they have been found as much affected with the dry rot
as many Canadian deals; though this has not happened
in so short a time as has been sufficient to rot Canadian
deals. The fungus growing on the Petersburgh deals and
Dram battens has all the characteristics and effects of dry
rot as exhibited in the Canadian deals, the detection of
dry rot being in most cases the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be remembered that white deal absorbs more
water than yellow; and yellow more water than red; and
the quantity of water absorbed by the white accounts for
its more rapid decay in external situations; as the greater
the quantity of water absorbed the quicker is the timber
destroyed. Mr. John Lingard, in his work on timber
(1842), states that he has proved that 4½ oz. of water can
be driven off from a small piece of fir, weighing only
10 oz. when wet, which is nearly half. This timber was
on a saw-pit, and going to be put into a building.</p>

<p>The most general, and the most fatal cause of decay,
viz. the wet rot, has attracted less attention than the more
startling, but less common evils, the dry rot, and the
destruction by insects.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Deane, in 1849, related before the Institution
of Civil Engineers of Ireland, an extraordinary
instance of the rapid decay of timber from rot, which
occurred in the church of the Holy Trinity at Cork.</p>

<p>On opening the floors under the pews, a most extraordinary
appearance presented itself. There were flat
fungi of immense size and thickness, some so large as
almost to occupy a space equal to the size of a pew, and
from 1 to 3 inches thick. In other places fungi appeared,
growing with the ordinary dry rot, some of an unusual
shape, in form like a convolvulus, with stems of from a
quarter to half an inch in diameter. When first exposed,
the whole was of a beautiful buff colour, and emitted the
usual smell of the dry-rot fungus.</p>

<p>During a great part of the time occupied in the repairs
of the church, the weather was very rainy. The arches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the vaults having been turned before the roof was
slated, the rain water saturated the partly decayed oak
beams. The flooring and joists, composed of fresh timber,
were laid on the vaulting before it was dry, coming in
contact at the same time with the old oak timber, which
was abundantly supplied with the seeds of decay, stimulated
by moisture, the bad atmosphere of an ill-contrived
burial-place, and afterwards by heat from the stoves constantly
in use. All these circumstances account satisfactorily
for the extraordinary and rapid growth of the fungi.</p>

<p>Many instances might be mentioned of English oak
being affected with dry rot, under particular circumstances.
There was a great deal at the Duke of Devonshire’s,
at Chiswick, about 60 years ago. Needy builders,
who work for contract, sometimes use American oak, and
call it wainscot: it is a bad substitute for wainscot, being
very liable to warp and to be affected with dry rot. “I
know of one public building,” observed the late Mr. Henry
Warburton, M.P., “in which it has been introduced, and,
I suppose, paid for under that name.”</p>

<p>Another serious instance of the decay of timber from
rot occurred some time since in Old St. Pancras Church,
London. When the dry rot made its appearance, it
spread with amazing rapidity. Sometimes in the course
of a night, a fungus of about the consistence of newly-fallen
snow, and of a yellowish-white unwholesome
colour, would be found to have spread over a considerable
surface. The fungus was without shape, but in some cases
it rose to a height of 2, 3, or 4 inches above the planks
or other surfaces on which it grew. It could be cut with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a knife, leaving a clear edge on each side, and there did
not seem to be any covering or membrane over the outer
or under surface. The smell of those matters was unpleasant,
and seemed like the concentration of the smell
which had pervaded the church for so long a time before;
and, in a short time, beams, planks of flooring, railings, &amp;c.,
were reduced to rottenness: the colour changed, and a
heavy dark-brown dust fell, and represented the once
solid timber. On making an examination with a view of
discovering the cause of the attack, it was found that in
the graveyard, near the church, there were graves, and
several vaults: there were also vaults in the inside of
the church. Most of them were filled, or nearly so, with
water, which had run from the overcrowded graves.</p>

<p>In the interior there were water-logged vaults, and the
walls were saturated with damp. It was also seen that
from want of proper spouts and drains, near the outer
walls, the drip from the large pent roof had fallen into
the foundations. In this situation, when the window
frames were properly arranged, a drain dug round and
from parts of the church, and other alterations, which
should long before have been made, were completed, the
dry rot vanished, and no more complaints of the foulness
of the air have since been heard.</p>

<p>We could quote many cases of rot which have been
caused from the want of proper drains and spouts. Architects
should remember that the feet of Gothic collar roofs
have to bear the whole weight of the roof, and unless well
seasoned, and carefully protected from damp, leaks, &amp;c.,
premature decay and dry rot will be sure to occur. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
surprising what injury leaks from gutters will sometimes
do. In 1851, Professor T. L. Donaldson stated that “a
brestsummer of American timber was used some time
since at a house in London: after an expiration of three
years cracks began to appear in the front wall. A friend
of mine, an architect, was called in to find out the cause;
and after examining different parts of the house, was
almost giving up his search in despair, when he thought
he would have the shop cornice removed and look at the
brestsummer. He then discovered that some water had
been admitted by accident, and penetrating the brestsummer,
had caused it to rot, and crack the wall.”</p>

<p>Dry rot was found in the great dome of the Bank of
England, London, as originally built by Sir Robert
Taylor: it also existed in the Society of Arts building, in
the Adelphi, London. It was also found in the domes of
the Panthéon, and Halle-au-Blé, Paris; but we hope there
is no dry rot in the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London,
which is constructed entirely of timber, covered externally
with lead.</p>

<p>The decayed state of a barn floor attacked by rot is
thus described by Mr. B. Johnson: “An oak barn floor
which had been laid twelve years began to shake upon
the joists, and on examination was found to be quite
rotten in various parts. The planks, 2½ inches in thickness,
were nearly eaten through, except the outsides,
which were glossy, and apparently without blemish. The
rotten wood was partly in the state of an impalpable
powder, of a snuff colour; other parts were black, and the
rest clearly fungus. No earth was near the wood.” This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
oak was probably of the <i>Quercus sessiliflora</i> species; and
there was no ventilation to the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. John Armstrong, carpenter, employed for many
years at Windsor Castle, observed: “I was employed a
few years back at a house where I found a floor rotten.
We took it up; it was yellow pine; it was laid in the
damp, but on sleepers, and the sleepers were not rotten:
they were of a different description of wood.” Probably
the sleepers were of Baltic red wood.</p>

<p>Dr. Carpenter relates an instance of the expansive
power resulting from the rapid growth of the soft cellular
tissue of fungi. About the commencement of this century
the town of Basingstoke was paved; and not many
months afterwards the pavement was observed to exhibit
an unevenness which could not easily be accounted for.
In a short time after, the mystery was explained, for some
of the heaviest stones were completely lifted out of their
beds by the growth of large toadstools beneath them.
One of these stones measured 22 inches by 21 inches,
and weighed 83 lb., and the resistance afforded by the
mortar which held it in its place would probably be even
a greater obstacle than the weight. A similar incident
came under the notice of Mr. M. C. Cooke (the author of
‘British Fungi’), of a large kitchen hearthstone which
was forced up from its bed by an under-growing fungus,
and had to be relaid two or three times, until at last it
reposed in peace, the old bed having been removed to the
depth of 6 inches, and a new foundation laid. A circumstance
recorded by Sir Joseph Banks is still more extraordinary,
of a cask of wine which, having been confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
for three years in a cellar, was, at the termination of that
period, found to have leaked from the cask, and vegetated
in the form of immense fungi, which had filled the cellar,
and borne upwards the empty wine cask.</p>

<p>Timber decay in contact with stone is a subject deserving
consideration. This decay is entirely obviated by
inserting the wood in an iron shoe, or by placing a thin
piece of iron between the wood and the stone. It is said
that a hard crust is formed on the timber in contact with
the iron, which seems effectually to preserve it; it is, of
course, necessary that a free circulation of air round the
ends of the timber be provided. The most notable
instance of timber decay in contact with stone with
which we are acquainted occurred at the coronation of
George IV. Westminster Hall was then fitted up, and
they began by laying sleepers of yellow pine. The coronation
was suspended for twelve months, and when the
sleepers were taken up from the floor of Westminster
Hall, they were in a rotten state.</p>

<p>Timber in contact with brickwork is in Suffolk and in
some parts of England covered with sheet lead to preserve
it from the effects of the damp mortar. Fungi will arise
in mortar, if made with road-drift, and water from stagnant
ponds, &amp;c., and it may be traced through the mortar
joints, and will thus appear on both sides of a wall.
Mortar composed of unwashed sand will generate fungi;
sea sand, even if washed, should never be used. It is
considered that the system of grouting contributes to
the early decay of timber; wood bond timber for walls
has been consequently replaced by hoop iron bond. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Manchester wood bond is frequently used, and is said
to answer well, but the high temperature of the buildings
may be a preventive against the decay of timber, as the
walls are soon dried. The practice is a bad one.</p>

<p>When timber used as posts inserted in the ground is
placed in the inverted position to that in which it stood
when growing, it is said to be very much more durable
than if placed in its natural or growing position. This is
easily accounted for in the valves of the sap vessels of the
growing timber opening upwards; but when that position
is inverted, the valves of the sap vessels become reversed
in their action; and, therefore, when timber is used as
posts inserted in the ground, the valves being so reversed
prevent the ascent of moisture from the soil in the wood.
Mr. W. Howe relates an experiment made to test the comparative
durability of posts set as they grew. He says,
“Sixteen years ago I set six pairs of bar posts all split
out of the butt end of the same white oak log. One pair I
set butts down; another pair, one butt down, the other top
down; the others top down. Four years ago those set
butt down were all rotted off, and had to be replaced by
new ones. This summer I had occasion to reset those
that were set top down: I found them all sound enough
to reset. My experiments have convinced me that the
best way is to set them tops down.” Other instances
might be given in favour of placing posts in an inverted
position in the ground. Posts will sometimes decay, for
the following reason: The ends are often sawn off with a
coarse implement and left spongy, with the longitudinal
fibres shaken or broken a considerable way within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
extremity of the wood. In this state the ends of the posts
must be apt to absorb from the ground the moisture,
which, being retained, and speedily pervading the whole
internal surface, <i>especially if painted</i>, appears to cause
decay.</p>

<p>With respect to the preservation of wooden fences, Mr.
Cruikshank, of Marcassie, gives in detail various experiments
from which it appears that&mdash;1st. When larch or
pine wood is to be exposed to the weather, or to be put in
the ground, no bark should be left on. 2nd. When posts
are to be put in the ground, no earth should be put round
them, but stones. 3rd. When a wooden fence is to be
put up, a No. 4 or No. 5 wire should be stretched in place
of, or alongside the upper rail.</p>

<p>Mr. G. S. Hartig, in the ‘Revue Horticole,’ gives the
results of experiments made with great care and patience,
upon woods buried in the earth. Pieces of wood of various
kinds 3⅛th inches square, were buried about one inch
below the surface of the ground, and they decayed in the
following order: the lime, American birch, alder, and
the trembling-leaved poplar, in three years; the common
willow, horse-chestnut, and plane, in four years; the maple,
red beech, and common birch, in five years; the elm, ash,
hornbeam, and Lombardy poplar, in six years; the oak,
Scotch fir, Weymouth pine, and silver fir, were only decayed
to the depth of half an inch in seven years; the
larch, common juniper, red cedar, and arbor vitæ, at the
end of the last-mentioned period remained uninjured. The
duration of their respective woods greatly depends on their
age and quality; specimens from young trees decaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
much quicker than those from sound old trees; and, when
well seasoned, they, of course, last much longer than when
buried in an unseasoned state. In experiments with the
woods cut into thin boards, decay proceeded in the following
order: the plane, horse-chestnut, poplar, American
birch, red beech, hornbeam, alder, ash, maple, silver fir,
Scotch fir, elm, Weymouth pine, larch, locust oak.</p>

<p>Before quitting the subject of decay of timber when
buried in the earth, it will not be out of place to allude
to the decay of railway sleepers, taking for example those
in India: English and American sleepers will be dealt
with more in detail hereafter.</p>

<p>Dr. Cleghorn, Conservator of Forests, Madras Presidency,
India, considers the decay of sleepers to arise in a
great measure from the inferior description of wood used.
Mr. Bryce McMaster, Resident Engineer, Salem, considers
that the native wood sleepers in India have hitherto
been found for the most part to fail on the Madras Railway,
between 30 and 40 per cent. requiring to be renewed
annually. Mr. McMaster undertook an investigation with
a view of ascertaining the causes of this deterioration, and
whether those causes could be overcome so as to render
available the vast resources of India. Thirteen hundred
sleepers of sixteen different woods were submitted to careful
examination and scrutiny twice at an interval of one
year. The sleepers were variously placed, both on embankments
and in cuttings; in some cases they were
entirely covered with ballast to a depth of 4 inches;
while in others they were as much as possible uncovered,
and completely so from the rails to the ends&mdash;the ballast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
being only raised 2 inches in the middle of the way,
and sloped off so as to carry away the water under the
rails. From these observations it appeared that only five
woods, Chella wungé, Kara mardá, Palai, Karúvalem, and
Ilupé, were sound at the end of two years, the other eleven
not lasting even that time. Also, that when the sleepers
were uncovered, decay was less rapid than when they were
buried in the ballast. The plan of leaving the sleepers
partially uncovered had many advantages; it effected a
saving of the ballast, allowed the defects to be more quickly
detected, and kept the sleepers drier. It had been urged
that the heat of the sun would split the sleepers and cause
the keys and treenails to shrink; but from experience it
was found that while among the “uncovered” sleepers
there was a large proportion “beginning to split,” or
“useless from being split,” there was on the other hand,
among the “covered” sleepers, a still larger proportion
“beginning to rot,” or “useless from being rotten.” It was
also noticed that of the sleepers “beginning to rot,” 19 per
cent. had commenced under one or both chairs. This was
due to the retention of moisture under them, and might
be remedied by tarring the seats of the chairs. As regarded
the treenails where the sleepers were rotten, the
treenails were invariably found to be in the same state;
while, when the heads were exposed to the sun, they were
not loosened by shrinking. Another objection was, that
the road would be more likely to buckle and twist, but
this was not found in practice to be the case. Treenails
made in India cost 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> to 4<i>l.</i> per 1000, and the woods
generally used for the purpose are Vengé, Kara mardá,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Erul, Porasa, or satin wood, and Trincomalee. The three
woods first named are also extensively employed for keys,
but teak keys seem to be the best, and their cost does not
exceed 6<i>l.</i> per 1000. From the experience of the Indian
engineers it appears that Teak, Saul, Sisso, Pedowk, Kara
mardá, Acha, Vengé, Chella wungé, Palai, Erul, Karúvalem,
will make very good sleepers to be used plain.</p>

<p>The sleepers which have failed on the Madras Railway
might well be divided into two classes,&mdash;those which were
originally of perishable woods, and were therefore unfit for
the purpose; and those which although of good wood had
been cut from young trees, and not been allowed to stand
until old enough. The first arose from want of experience
of the nature of Indian woods: the second from the absence
of a proper system of working the jungles.</p>

<p>The wooden sleepers on the Indian railways should be
tarred under the seats of the chairs, be laid in dry ballast,
and raised slightly in the middle, and sloped off so as to
throw the water under the rails. About two-thirds of the
Indian woods are practically useless owing to the want of
proper artificial means for preserving those of a perishable
nature.</p>

<p>The subject of the decay of wood in India and tropical
climates is too extensive to be further considered here;
but is of sufficient importance to demand a volume to
itself; the renewal of decayed wooden sleepers to railways
forming annually a most important item in foreign railway
budgets.</p>

<p>We have heard that some of our fortifications which
have been erected within the last few years to protect our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
English coast from invasion, have already been invaded
by dry rot. If this be true, some one well acquainted
with the subject should at once be appointed to find out
the cause, and recommend the remedy in each case.</p>

<p>Professional men, if they wish their works to “live for
ever,” should consider the after consequences of neglecting
to provide against dry rot. If the fungi could speak
from under floors, ceiled-up roofs, behind wainscots,
girders, &amp;c., we should often hear them exclaim, “A nice
moist piece of wood! Surely this belongs to us.” On the
beams of a building at Crawley, a carpenter many years
ago cut a few words; they are full of meaning in connection
with our subject, and they run as follows:</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">FELLING TIMBER.</span></h2>

<p>The end to be attained in the management of timber
trees is to produce from a given number the largest
possible amount of sound and durable woods. When a
tree, under conditions favourable to its growth, ceases
increasing the diameter of its trunk, and loses its foliage
earlier in the autumn than it is wont to do, and when the
top of the tree brings forth no leaves in spring, these
facts may be considered as indications of decline, and that
the tree is of sufficient age to be felled. The state of the
upper branches of a tree may be considered to be amongst
the best indications of its soundness, and provided they be
in a healthy condition, the withering of the lower branches
is a matter of comparatively small importance.</p>

<p>Trees may be considered as tall, middle rank, and low,
and the size to which they will attain depends on many
different circumstances. Some trees, the stems of which
are short on the average, as the lime, are virtually of tall
growth, from the manner in which a number of vertical
branches of large size ascend from the stem. And other
trees, again, whose branches are comparatively short, are
of tall growth, in consequence of the length of the stems&mdash;like
the beech.</p>

<p>The average duration of trees differs, as is well known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in different species, and they exhibit different symptoms of
decay. There are oaks in Windsor Great Park, certainly
nearly one thousand years old, and which exhibit even now
no appearance of approaching the end of their life. Mr.
Menzies, the surveyor, in his work on Windsor Great
Park, describes some of the indications of incipient decay
which are peculiar to the several kinds of trees. “When a
beech begins to fail,” he says, “fungi appear either at the
roots or on the forks, the leaves curl up as if they had
been scorched, and the tree quickly perishes. In an elm,
a great limb first fails, while the rest of the tree continues
green and vigorous, but in a few years the whole tree
suddenly dies. Coniferous trees die gradually, but quickly.
The oak shows the first symptoms at the points of its
highest branches, while the rest of the tree will remain
healthy and sound for years.” This peculiarity of the
oak did not escape the eye of Shakespere, that universal
observer, who describes the monarch of the woods as
not only having its boughs mossed with age, but its</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The age for felling trees is a subject which calls for the
deepest consideration, but does not always receive that
attention which is due to its importance. Timber growers
in their haste to supply the market, too often fell trees
that have not arrived at maturity, the heart-wood being
therefore imperfect, with much sap-wood, and, of course,
little durability; but unfortunately they are the more
readily led to do so on account of the increase in size
being very slow after a certain age. Builders are sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the inferior quality of young timber in respect to duration,
and it is their province to check this growing
evil, by giving a better price for timber that has
acquired a proper degree of density and hardness; but,
unfortunately, this is an age for cheap building, without
much regard being given as to durability.</p>

<p>Felling should not be too early, for the reasons above
mentioned; neither should it be in the decline of the tree,
when its elasticity and vigour are lost, and the wood
becomes brittle, tainted, and discoloured, with the pith
gone, and the heart in progress of decay. Maturity is the
period when the sap-wood bears a small proportion, and
the heart-wood has become uniform and compact. Sir
John Evelyn writes, “It should be in the vigour and perfection
of trees, that a felling should be celebrated.” It
must be obvious, however, that it is a worse fault to fell
wood before it has acquired thorough firmness, than when
it is just in the wane, and its heart may exhibit but the
first symptoms of decay; for in the former there is no
perfect enduring timber to be got, while in the latter the
greater part is in the zenith of its strength.</p>

<p>Although there are certain symptoms by which it may
be ascertained when a tree is on the decline, it is somewhat
difficult to decide just when a tree is at maturity.
From the investigations of naturalists, however, it may be
safe to consider that hard-wood trees, as oak and chestnut,
should never be cut before they are sixty years old, the
average age for felling being from eighty to ninety years,
and the average quantity of timber produced by a tree of
that age is about a load and a half, or about 75 cubic feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Daviller states (see ‘Cours d’Architecture’) “that an
oak should not be felled at a less age than sixty years.”
Belidor considers (see ‘Sciences des Ingénieurs’) “that
one hundred years is the best age for the oak to be
felled.”</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the times mentioned are
by no means arbitrary, for situation, soil, &amp;c., have much
to do with it. For the soft woods, as the Norway spruce
and Scotch pine in Norway, the proper age is between
seventy and one hundred years. The ash, larch, and elm,
may be cut when the trees are between fifty and ninety
years old; and between thirty and fifty years is a proper
age for poplars.</p>

<p>The felling of timber was looked upon by ancient
architects as a matter of much moment. According to
Vitruvius, the proper time for felling is between October
and February, and he directs that the trees should be cut
to the pith, and then suffered to remain till the sap be
drained out. The effusion of the sap prevents the decay
of the timber, and when it is all drained out, and the wood
becomes dry, the trees are to be cut down, when the
wood will be excellent for use. A similar effect might be
produced by placing the timber on its end as soon as it is
felled, and it would, no doubt, compensate for the extra
expense by its durability in use. In France, so long ago
as 1669, a royal order limited the felling of naval timber
from the 1st October to 15th April, when the “wind was
at north,” and “in the wane of the moon.” Buonaparte
directed that the time for felling naval timber should be
“in the decrease of the moon, from 1st November to 15th
March,” in order to render it more durable. In England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the first year of James I., there was an Act of Parliament
prohibiting every one from cutting oak timber,
except in the barking season, under a severe penalty.</p>

<p>James I. was not the only English sovereign who has
been concerned with timber trees; for King John was
obliged to cancel at Runnemede the cruel forest laws
enacted by his father, William the Conqueror, especially
those restricting the people from fattening their hogs.</p>

<p>Up to a recent period large droves of hogs were fattened
upon the acorns of the New Forest in Hampshire.
At the present time the hogs of Estremadura are principally
fed upon the acorns of the <i>Ballota</i> oak; and to
this cause is assigned the great delicacy of their flesh.</p>

<p>A Berkshire labourer, living near Windsor Forest, thus
speaks of the delicacy of acorn-fed pork: “Well, that be
pretty like the thing. I hadn’t tasted the like o’ that this
many a day. It is so meller&mdash;when you gets your teeth
on it, you thinks you has it; but afore you knows where
you is, ain’t it wanished!”</p>

<p>There is another point in connection with the time of
felling timber, which ought to be noticed. It is a widespread
opinion that trees should be felled during the wane
of the moon. This planetary influence is open to doubt,
but the opinion prevails wherever there are large forests.
Columella, Cato, Vitruvius, and Pliny, all had their
notions of cutting timber at certain ages of the moon.
The wood-cutters of South America act upon it, so do
their brethren in the German forests, in Brazil, and in
Yucatan. It was formerly interwoven in the Forest Code
of France, and, we believe, is so still. Vitruvius recommends
this custom, and we find Isaac Ware writing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
suggestion: “This has been laughed at, and supposed
to be an imaginary advantage. There may be good in
following the practice; there can be no harm: and therefore,
when I am to depend upon my timber, I will observe
it.” The Indian wood-cutters believe that timber is
much more liable to decay, if cut when the moon is in
crescent.</p>

<p>An American writer, in 1863, thus writes of his experience
in the matter: “Tradition says that the ‘old’
of the moon, in February, is the best time to cut timber;
but from more than twenty years of observation and
actual experience, I am fully convinced it is about the
worst time to cut most, if not all kinds of hard-wood
timber. Birch, ash, and most or all kinds of hard
wood will invariably <i>powder-post</i> if cut any time in the fall
after the tree is frozen, or before it is thoroughly leaved
out in the spring of the year. But if cut after the sap in
the tree is used up in the growth of the tree, until freezing
weather again comes, it will in no instance produce the
<i>powder-post</i> worm. When the tree is frozen, and cut in
this condition, the worm first commences its ravages on
the inside film of the bark, and then penetrates the wood
until it destroys the sap part thereof. I have found the
months of August, September, and October, to be the
three best in the year to cut hard-wood timber. If cut in
these months, the timber is harder, more elastic, and
durable than if cut in winter months. I have, by weighing
timber, found that of equal quality got out for joiners’
tools is much heavier when cut and got out in the above-named
months than in the winter and spring months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and it is not so liable to crack. You may cut a tree in
September, and another in the ‘old’ of the moon in
February following, and let them remain, and in one year
from the cutting of the first tree, you will find it sound
and unhurt, while the one last cut is scarcely fit for firewood,
from decay. Chestnut timber for building will last
longest, provided the bark be taken off. Hemlock and
pine ought to be cut before being hard frozen, although
they do not <i>powder-post</i>; yet if they are cut in the middle
of winter, or in the spring of the year, and the bark is
not taken off, the grub will immediately commence its
ravages between the bark and the wood. I have walnut
timber on hand which has been cut from one to ten years,
with the bark on, which was designed for ox-helves and
ox-bows, and not a worm is to be found therein; it was
cut between 1st August and 1st November. I have other
pieces of similar timber cut in the winter months, not two
year’s old, and they are entirely destroyed, being full of
<i>powder-post</i> and grub-worms.”</p>

<p>What shall we say when doctors disagree? The theory
given to account for what is assumed to be a fact, is, that
as the moon grows the sap rises, and the wood, therefore
is less dense than when the moon is waning, because at
that time the sap in the tree diminishes. No evidence
whatever can be offered in support of the theory, and one
would certainly imagine that the rise or fall of the sap
would depend on the quantity of heat which reaches the
foot of the tree, and not at all on attraction.</p>

<p>All investigations tend to prove that the only proper
time for felling timber is that at which the tree contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the least sap. There are two seasons in each year when
the vessels are filled. One is in spring, when the fluid is
in motion to supply nutriment to the leaves, and deposit
material for new wood; the other is in the early part of
autumn, when, after the stagnation which gives the new
wood time to dry and harden, it again flows to make the
vegetable deposits in the vessels of the wood. At neither
of these times should trees be felled; for, if the pores be
full of vegetable juices, which being acted upon by heat
and moisture may ferment, the wood will decay. Of the
two periods, the spring must be the worst, because the
wood then contains the greatest quantity of matter in a
state fit for germination.</p>

<p>The results of a series of experiments made in Germany
show that December-cut wood allows no water to pass
through it longitudinally; January-cut wood passed in
forty-eight hours a few drops; February-cut wood let two
quarts of water through its interstitial spaces in forty-eight
hours; March-cut wood permitted the same to filter
through in two and a half hours. Hence the reasons
why barrels made from wood cut in March or April are
so leaky, as the sap is then rising, and the trees are
preparing to put forth their leaves.</p>

<p>It thus happens that the time for felling is midsummer
or midwinter. The best time for felling, according to
some, is midsummer, when the leaves are fully expanded,
and the sap has ceased to flow, and the extraneous vegetable
matter intended for the leaves has been dislodged
from the trunk of the tree by the common sap, leaving it
in a quiescent state, and free from that germinative principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
which is readily excited by heat and moisture, and
if the timber were cut while it remained, would subject it
to rapid decay and to operations of worms. Midwinter,
amongst some, is chosen as a time for felling, as it is
stated that winter-felled heart-wood is less affected by
moisture, and likely to be the best and most durable; but
as the only peculiar recommendation which that time
possesses is the facility which it affords for gradual
seasoning, by which timber is rendered less liable to split
and get distorted, and slow drying being generally available
at any season under shade and shelter, midsummer
appears for many obvious reasons the most expedient.
In general, all the soft woods, such as elm, lime, poplar,
willow, should be felled during winter. In some kinds of
trees a little after midsummer appears to be decidedly
the best time for felling. Alder felled at that time is
found to be much more durable; and Ellis observes, that
beech when cut in the middle of summer is bitter, and
less liable to be worm-eaten, particularly if a gash be cut
to let out the sap some time before felling. Mr. Knowles
states that, “About Naples, and in other parts of Italy,
oaks have been felled in summer, and are said to have
been very durable.” Most of the trees in southern Italy
are felled in July and August, and the pines in the
German forests are cut down mostly in summer time, and
it is stated that their wood is sound.</p>

<p>The following are advocates for winter felling, viz.
Cato, Pliny, Vitruvius, Alberti, Hesiod, De Saussure,
Evelyn, Darwin, and Buonaparte. Some of them consider
that winter-felled timber, which has been barked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
notched in the previous spring, loses much of that half-prepared
woody matter, containing seeds of fungi, &amp;c., that
there is no doubt of its superiority to summer-felled timber.</p>

<p>The age at which trees should be felled, and the most
suitable time for the work having been determined, there
are two other things which claim attention.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> of these is the removal of the bark from the
trunk and principal branches of the tree. For, in oak
trees, the bark is too valuable to be lost; and as the best
period for the timber is the worst for the bark, an ingenious
method has been long partially practised, which
not only secures the bark at the best season, but also
materially improves the timber. This method consists in
taking the bark off the standing tree early in the spring,
and not felling it till after the new foliage has put forth
and died. This practice has been considered of inestimable
value; for by it the sap-wood is rendered as strong and
durable as the heart-wood; and in some particular instances
experiments have shown it to be four times as
strong as other wood in all respects similar, and grown
on the same soil, but felled with the bark on and dried in
sheds. Buffon, Du Hamel, and, in fact, most naturalists,
have earnestly recommended the practice. Evelyn states,
“To make excellent boards, bark your trees in a fit season,
and let them stand naked a full year before felling.”</p>

<p>In regard to the time that should elapse between the
removal of the bark and the felling of a tree, a variety of
opinions exist. It was the usual custom of early architects
to remove the bark in the spring, and fell the trees
during the succeeding winter. Later investigations seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to have proved that it is better to perform the work three
or even four years in advance, instead of one, although
Tredgold appears to think one year too long. Trees will,
in most situations, continue to expand and leaf out for
several seasons after the bark has been removed. The
sap remaining in the wood gradually becomes hardened
into woody substance, thereby closing the sap vessels and
making it more solid. As bark separates freely from the
wood in spring, while the sap is in motion, it should be
taken off at that period. When the above method is not
adopted, it is well either to pierce the trunk some time
before felling to drain out the sap, or immediately on its
being felled to set it on end.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> suggestion is, to cut into and around the
entire trunk of the tree, near the roots, so that the sap
may be discharged; for in this manner it will be done
more easily than it can be by evaporation after the tree
is felled. In addition to this, if it be permitted to run
out at the incision, a large portion of the new and fermentable
matter will pass out with it, which would remain in
the wood if only such material is removed as would pass
off by evaporation. This cutting should be made in the
winter previous to the August in which the tree is to be
felled; and the incision should be made as deep into the
heart-wood as possible without inducing a premature fall
of the tree.</p>

<p>The custom of ringing or girdling the tree before felling
has been advocated, on the ground that the seasoning is
thereby expedited, and also more thoroughly effected.
This is doubtful, at least, in oil-containing trees (as teak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
&amp;c.), but the practice appears to be contra-indicated for
other reasons: when a tree has been ringed, many wood-cutters
object to cut it down on account of its increased
hardness. This objection might be waived, were it not for
another and more serious one which has been adduced.
It is believed to be a fact by some that trees felled after
girdling have the heart shake increased. It is difficult
to explain this, if it be actually the case.</p>

<p>Many suggestions might be made as regards the mechanical
operation of felling trees, with which ancient
nations were not unfamiliar:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>… “for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill
to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.”&mdash;1 Kings v. 6.</p>

</div>

<p>But as these operations are familiar to all intelligent
workmen, it is only necessary to mention one, viz. the
value of removing from the side of the tree such branches
as will strike the ground when it falls, and, by wrenching,
cleave the grain of the wood, and thereby injure the
timber. Such defects, which are often found after the
timber has been seasoned, could not be discovered when it
left the mill.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we can truly state that the most extensive
felling of trees for <i>one building</i> only which we have
ever heard or read of is the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and
fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains.”&mdash;1 Kings v. 15.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON SEASONING TIMBER BY NATURAL METHODS, VIZ. HOT
AND COLD AIR; FRESH AND SALT WATER; VAPOUR;
SMOKE; STEAM; BOILING; CHARRING AND SCORCHING,
ETC.</span></h2>

<p>All timber must, whether it be sap-wood or heart-wood,
be placed in situations which will allow the sap to exude or
evaporate, and this process is the one technically known
by the term “seasoning.” There are natural and artificial
modes of seasoning, both of which have their recommendations;
but the former has certainly the right of
preference, as it gives greater toughness, elasticity, and
durability, and therefore should always be employed in
preparing timber for carpentry. As the word “timber”
has been frequently used, it may be as well to state that
it is derived, according to Dr. Johnson, from the Saxon,
<i>timbrian</i>, to build: hence the above definition. The legal
definition of timber is restricted to particular species of
wood, and custom varies in different countries as to the
species ranked among the timber trees.</p>

<p>When a tree is felled, it encloses in its fibres as well as
in capillary channels a considerable quantity of sap,
which is nothing else but water charged with gummy,
saccharine, saline, mucilaginous, and albuminous matters.
In this state, the latter are very liable to ferment, but
they lose their liability when, by the evaporation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sap, they pass to a dry and solid state; so that the first
suggestion which naturally presents itself to the mind, is
to subject the timber to a lengthened seasoning.</p>

<p>But the present demands for time will not admit of
this, and therefore it is imperative to resort to artificial
and speedy methods.</p>

<p>With respect to the value of timber in the log, owing
to its becoming rent by the weather, it sells for 15 per
cent. less the second year than the first, and so on for less
and less the longer you keep it.</p>

<p>A natural seasoning may be adopted for specimens of
moderate thickness, such as deals, planks, &amp;c. At the
end of eighteen months from the time of importation
they are scarcely dry enough for the consumer’s use.</p>

<p>When there is time for drying it gradually, all that is
necessary to be done on removing it from the damp ground
of the forest, is to place it in a dry yard, sheltered from
the sun and wind, and where there is no vegetation; and
set it on bearers of iron or brick in such a manner as to
admit of a ventilation all round and under it. In this
manner it should continue two years, if intended for
carpentry; and double that time, if intended for joinery;
the loss of weight which should take place to render it
fit for the purposes of the former being about one-fifth;
and for the latter about one-third. In piling it, the
sleepers on which the first pieces are laid should be perfectly
level, and “out of the wind,” and so firm and
solid throughout that they will remain in their original
position; for timber, if bent or made to wind before it is
seasoned, will generally retain the same form when dried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Blocks of wood should be put between the “sticks” of
timber, and each piece directly over the other, so that air
may freely pass through the whole pile; for while it is
necessary to shield timber from strong draughts of wind
and the direct action of the hot sun, a free circulation of
air and moderate warmth are equally essential.</p>

<p>If timber is not used round, it is good to bore out the
core; as, by so doing, the drying is advanced, and
splitting prevented, with almost no sacrifice of strength.
If it is to be squared into logs, it should be done soon
after some slow drying, and whole squared, if large
enough, as that removes much of the sap-wood, facilitates
the drying, and prevents splitting, which is apt to take
place when it is in the round form, in consequence of the
sap-wood drying before the heart, from being less dense.
If it may be quartered, it is well to treat it so after some
time, as the seasoning is by that means rendered more
equal. It is well also to turn it now and then, as the
evaporation is greatest from the upper side. In France,
the term “bois du brin,” means timber the whole size of
the tree, excepting that which is taken off to render it
square.</p>

<p>To prevent timber warping to any serious extent, it
should be well seasoned before it is cut into scantlings; and
the scantlings should be cut some time before they are to
be used, in order that the seasoning may be as perfect as
possible; and if they can be set upright, so much the better,
as then they will dry more rapidly. The white lowland
deals of Norway and the white spruce deals of Canada
have the same disposition to warp and split on drying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Du Hamel has shown that it is a great advantage to set
the timber upright, with the lower end raised a little from
the ground; but as this cannot always be done, the timber-yards
should be well drained and kept as dry as possible.
“Ancient architects,” observes Alberti, “not only prevented
the access of the scorching rays of the sun and the rude
blasts of wind, but also covered the surface with cow-dung,
to prevent the too sudden evaporation from the surface.”
The warping of timber is attributable by some to the
manner of its growth. Boards cut out of a tree that is
twisted in its growth will not keep from warping; boards
cut from trees that are grown in open situations have
another fault, in the heart of the tree not running straight
like forest-grown wood. In a plank cut from a tree of
this kind in a straight line, the heart will traverse it
from one end to another. No treatment will prevent it
from warping or drying hollow on the side farthest from
the heart. Where the heart is in the centre of a plank,
and each side has an equal chance of drying, it will not
warp; but there will be a shake or crack upon each side,
denoting the position of the heart.</p>

<p>Some deals, and particularly the stringy deals, are very
hygrometric, and never lose the property, however long
they have been seasoned, of expanding and contracting
with change of weather. White Petersburgh deals are
said to have that property, however long they may have
been kept, so that if used in the panel of a door, the
wood alternately enters and recedes from the groove into
which it fits, as the paint will show when that kind of
deal has been used for a panel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The wood of the north side will not warp so much as
the wood from the south side. The face of the planks
should be cut in the direction which lay from east to
west as the tree stood. If this be done, the planks will
warp much less than if cut in the opposite direction.
The nature of the tree, the soil upon which it is grown,
the position of its growth, the period of the year in which
it is felled, and the length of time between its felling and
converting, are the principal points to be considered; a
thorough knowledge and study of which is the only true
principle on which we can hope to deal with the warping
and converting of timber.</p>

<p>Wood, when it is cut into small pieces, very soon
acquires its utmost degree of dryness. Dr. Watson,
Bishop of Llandaff, in the month of March, cut a piece
from the middle of a large ash tree that had been felled
about six weeks, and weighed it; its weight was 317 grains.
In seven days it lost 62 grains, or nearly one-fifth of its
weight. It was weighed again in August of the same
year, but had not lost any more of its weight; hence it
had become perfectly dry in the short space of seven days.
He also found that the sap-wood of oak lost more weight
in drying than the heart-wood, in the proportion of 10 to 7.</p>

<p>The time that is required to season or dry a piece of
timber obviously depends upon its magnitude; as a
<i>general rule</i>, large timbers will not continue good so long
as small ones, as sufficient time is rarely given for a
thorough seasoning. The time required to dry a piece of
timber, all other things being alike, will depend on the
quantity of surface exposed to the action of the air;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
therefore, while the quantity of timber remains the same,
the larger the surface, the sooner it will dry. Also, if the
quantity of surface remains the same, the time of drying
will be proportioned to the quantity of matter; as the
greater the quantity of matter under the same surface,
the longer it will be in drying.</p>

<p>As drying proceeds most rapidly in small pieces, it is
therefore important to reduce the timber to its proper
scantlings or size for use; for however dry a piece of
timber may be, when it is cut to a smaller scantling it
will shrink and lose weight, being always less dry in
the centre than at the surface; and the more rapidly
the drying has been carried on, the greater will be the
difference. Nevertheless, in the first stage of seasoning
it is best that it should proceed slowly; otherwise, the
external pores shrink so close as not to permit the full
evaporation of the internal moisture, and the piece would
split from unequal shrinking; and lastly, it should be
reduced to the proper scantling, as already observed,
some time before it is to be framed. Various tables have
been given by writers on timber, the result of algebraical
calculations, of the times of seasoning and drying for
different woods of different lengths, breadths, and thicknesses,
in the open air; but as wood even of the same
description and quality varies so much, this matter is best
left to those who are well acquainted with timber. It
may, however, be stated that the time required for drying
under cover is shorter than in the open air, in the proportion
of 5 to 7.</p>

<p>The English shipwright considers that three years are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
required to thoroughly season timber. The timbers for
ships are usually cut out to their shape and dimensions
for about a year before they are framed together, and they
are commonly left a year longer in the skeleton shape to
complete the seasoning, as in that condition they are
more favourably situate as regards exposure to the air
than when they are closely covered in with planking.</p>

<p>It is worthy of mention that all the harder woods
require increased care in the seasoning, which is often
badly begun by exposure to the sun or hot winds in their
native climates: their greater impenetrability to the air
the more disposes them to crack, and their comparative
scarcity and expense are also powerful arguments on the
score of precaution. Oak timber requires to be very carefully
seasoned, as it is generally used in buildings for the
best description of work, and should unseasoned oak be
used for “panelling,” any shrinkage will be fatal to the
work. Mr. George Marshall, timber merchant (see the
<i>Builder</i>, January 20, 1872), with respect to seasoning oak
timber, observes: “I should select oak trees known to be
old and hearty, with clean, straight butts, from 15 inches to
20 inches in diameter. I should then have the bark taken
off as they stand, and leave them thus till the winter; the
sap will then partially dry out, and make the wood a rich
brown colour. As soon as they are cut down, have them
sawn up at once into the lengths you require the panelling,
6 inches or 8 inches wide and 1 inch to 1½ inch
thick. Be careful to cut all the heart shakes, by having
one cut through the centre of the log before edging the
boards to the required width. With regard to the drying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
process, stack the boards in a shed with a good draught
through it, and load them down, with slips between each
board, to prevent warping. If this be done they will be
found to dry well and speedily, and they will not require
to be exposed to the weather.”</p>

<p>Sir. Robert Phillips, on seasoning oak for panelling,
states: “If the tree is large enough for the purpose, cut
it into four, in sections, by drawing a vertical and horizontal
line across the end, meeting in the centre. If too
small for this, cut it into 4½ inch or 6-inch plank, as
soon as possible after felling, and then stack <i>on end</i> out in
the open: do not lay on the ground, but stand it as nearly
<i>vertical</i> on its end as possible, and keep it wet during the
first three months. If the weather is dry, well <i>wet</i> it with
water poured on the top, and allowed to run down. Let
the ends stand on a piece of quartering, to keep it out of
the dirt, or it will be stained some distance up. After
standing thus for some six months, after putting it in a dry
place for some time, cut it into the scantlings you require,
always bearing in mind that oak will, after this seasoning,
shrink at least half an inch to a foot, in width and thickness.
They should then be stacked and stripped, and
covered with spare boards, and weighted on the top, for at
least six months&mdash;as much more as possible&mdash;in a covered
shed, with plenty of air, occasionally turned over and shifted,
till they are dry enough to make dust when planed, and not
turn the shaving black. They will then be fit for use.</p>

<p>“I should advise for the panels to be cut <i>feather-edged</i>
boards, in radial lines from the centre of the tree: it will
be a waste of material, but will repay in the beauty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
wood, and the way it will stand without warping. Most of
the panels of our old cathedrals were rent (<i>not sawn</i>) in this
way, and stand admirably. The butt of the tree should
be taken, the top being used for a rougher purpose.”</p>

<p>Mr. George Marshall and Mr. Robert Phillips might
have mentioned that the oak trees should be of the
<i>Quercus Robur</i> species, and <i>not</i> the <i>Quercus Sessiliflora</i>.
They are easily distinguished when growing by the following
peculiarities: The acorn-stalks of the <i>Robur</i> are
<i>long</i>; the acorns grow singly, or seldom two on the same
footstalk; the leaves are <i>short</i>. The acorn-stalks of the
<i>Sessiliflora</i> are <i>short</i>; the acorns grow in clusters of two
or three, close to the stem of the branch; the leaves are
<i>long</i>.</p>

<h3>WATER SEASONING.</h3>

<p>When there is not time for gradual drying, the best
method, perhaps, that can be adopted, especially for sappy
timber, and if strength is not principally required, is
immediately on felling to immerse it in running water;
and after allowing it to remain there about a fortnight, to
set it in the wind to dry. Some persons prefer this method
of seasoning timber, as they say it prevents cleaving, and
strips and seasons better afterwards. This process has
been adopted with good results by placing the boards end
on at the head of a mill race for fourteen or twenty days, at
most, and then setting the boards upright, and subject to
the action of the sun and wind; though it is questionable
whether the sun will not do them more harm than good.
As they stand, turn them daily, and when perfectly dry&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
process will take about one month&mdash;it is considered
they will be found to floor better than timber after many
years of dry seasoning. The sap-wood of oak is said to be
improved by this method, being much less subject to be
worm-eaten; and providing it is placed in fresh running
water, Mr. G. A. Rogers, the celebrated wood carver, is of
opinion that the colour of the oak is improved. The
more tender woods, such as alder and the like, are
less subject to the worm when water seasoned. Beech
is said to be much benefited by immersion. It should be
remembered that the timber should be altogether under
water (chained down beneath its surface), as partial
immersion is very destructive. Du Hamel considers
“that where strength is required, wood ought not to
be put in water.” Timber should never be kept floating
in ponds or docks, as in London; but it should be
stacked, as at Liverpool and Gloucester. Timber that
has been lying for months in ponds or docks is sometimes
cut up, and in six or seven days fixed in a building;
consequently, the usual result takes place, viz. dry rot.
After having been swelled by soaking much beyond its
former bulk, the baulk of timber is put on the saw-pit,
and cut into scantlings, and framed while in this wet
state, therefore it cannot be surprising that the dry rot
soon appears as a natural consequence.</p>

<p>Amongst wheelwrights the water seasoning is in general
favour. It is said that the colour of the white woods is
improved by water seasoning, boiling, or steaming. The
Venetians place the oak used for gun-carriages in water
for two years before it is used, and the timber for sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
service two or three years under water. The Turks do not
appear to pay any attention to seasoning, for they fell
their timber at all times of the year without any regard
to the season, and although they grow very good oak, it
is used so green and unseasoned that it not only twists,
but decays rapidly, as anyone may observe in the houses
at Constantinople and other Turkish towns.</p>

<p>Timber is rendered more durable by placing it in a
stream of water, saturated with lime, for eight or ten days,
and it also makes it less liable to the attack of worms;
but it, however, becomes hard after being dried, and is
difficult to be worked; and therefore the process should
be applied to timber which has been sawn into scantlings,
and is ready for use. Mr. William Chapman, in 1812,
considered that an immersion of timber in hot limewash
in deep ponds, exposing little surface to the air, merited a
trial; but in 1816, from experiments he had made, he was
of opinion that it had proved injurious to timber.</p>

<p>Evelyn states that green elm, if plunged for a few days
in water (especially salt water), obtains an admirable seasoning.
According to Society of Arts <i>Trans.</i>, 1819, every
trace of fungus was eradicated from the ship “Eden,” by
its remaining eighteen months under sea water. Salt water
is considered good for ship timber, but for timber to be
employed in the construction of dwelling-houses, fresh
water is better. Pliny notices, as a fact, that certain
woods on being dried after immersion in the sea acquire
additional density and durability. M. de Lapparent,
late Director of the French Navy, considers that timber
cannot be seasoned in salt water, but in fresh, or at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
most, in brackish water. The condition of the timber
which, at the port of Rochefort, is kept in ditches filled
with fresh water is in this respect most favourable; that
kept at Toulon, Brest, and Lorient, where the water is
brackish, is much less so; but to estimate their relative
advantages, it would be necessary to test the average
density of these waters. It is, however, at Cherbourg
that this natural preparation of timber is the most inefficient,
as the beds-of sand in which the timber is buried,
near the Pool of Tourlaville, contain but a small quantity
of water, which, being nearly always stagnant, very quickly
exhausts itself, and is very prejudicial.</p>

<p>At the Cologne International Agricultural Exhibition,
in 1865, three sleepers were exhibited from the Magdeburg
Leipsiger Railway, from the Salt Work Branch, at
Stassfurt, laid in 1857. These were moistened by the
refuse of the salt which was lost from the load and by the
rain. The jury in their Report stated that these sleepers
proved nothing, “because every old table on which fish or
meat has been salted, proves that a constant moistening
with salt water preserves the wood from decay, but as soon
as the process of salting is given up, the salted matter is
immediately given out, and the timber soon decays. In
this case it would have been important to have known
that these sleepers, after having been salted, had lain
anywhere else than in the Salt Work Branch without
getting fresh salt applied, and then to have seen if they
would have been as perfect as they are now. They,
indeed, prove nothing but the fact that if sleepers be
daily sprinkled with salt they will remain sound, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
price paid for this durability might be very considerable.”
As the use of salt as a preservative agent will be considered
in the next chapter, it will be best to defer the
consideration of salt-water seasoning until then.</p>

<p>In India, teak, sál, and blackwood, &amp;c., improve by
lying in water, or in the soft black mud of an estuary:
there is one exception, viz. heddé, which deteriorates from
steeping, and should be carted to its destination.</p>

<p>Evelyn states that he had found a fortnight’s immersion
in river water sufficient, and this opinion is held by
Silloway, a North American authority; but Dr. Porcher, a
South American writer, recommends a six months’ immersion
in water, and a six months’ exposure to wind and
shade. Vitruvius and Alberti consider that timber should
be left immersed in a running stream thirty days.</p>

<p>It is considered that the longer wood has remained
under water, the more rapidly it dries; for instance, every
one is aware that the firewood brought out of the river is
less green and burns better than that brought by waggon
or boat.</p>

<p>In 1817, Admiral Count Chateauvieux, a Sardinian
naval officer, observed to Mr. McWilliam that it was a
custom at the Royal Arsenal, at Genoa, as a preventive
against the diseases of timber, to steep it about three years
in fresh water immediately after it is felled. Mr. James
Dickson, of Gottenburg, timber merchant (member of
the firm Peter Dickson and Company, London), many
years engaged in the Swedish timber trade, observed in
1835, “If square timber lies in the water two or three
years, it rends at the heart, but I should not say it would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
perhaps, for the first year; but the exterior part rends
soon by exposure to the weather.” In 1818, the Chevalier
de Campugano, Secretary of Legation to the Spanish
Embassy, stated that in Spain, when timber is felled, it
is generally laid in water for a considerable time.</p>

<p>The sap in timber, by reason of the matters which it
holds in solution, is denser than pure water; moreover, it
is enclosed in fibres or channels permeable at the ends.</p>

<p>Supposing in submerged timber, the surrounding water
to be flowing, or at least changing, this water will conclude
by occupying, if not altogether, at least in a great
degree, the place of the sap, which will have issued forth,
carrying with it the fermenting principle with which it is
charged. The timber, therefore, which has remained
<i>sufficiently long</i> in the water ought to be much less susceptible
of fermentation than that seasoned only by the
atmosphere. Besides, as pure water evaporates much easier
than that which contains certain principles, this timber
ought to be seasoned much sooner than the other.</p>

<p>Of steeping generally, whether in cold or warm water,
it must be particularly observed that it dissolves the substance
of the wood, and necessarily renders it lighter;
indeed, it is known that notwithstanding wood that is
carefully submerged remains good for a very long period
after the water has dissolved a certain soluble part, it is,
when taken out and dried, liable to be brittle, and unfit
for any other work but joinery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h3>SEASONING BY STEAMING AND BOILING, ETC.</h3>

<p>For the purposes of joinery, steaming and boiling are
very good methods, as the loss of elasticity and strength
which they produce, and which are essential in carpentry,
is compensated by the tendency to shrinkage being reduced;
the durability also is said by some to be rather
improved than otherwise, at least from steaming. If
steaming be not carried on too quickly it will answer, but
if it be pushed with too much vigour it is very apt to produce
a permanent warping and distortion of the material.
Oak of British growth may be seasoned by this process,
as without this precaution it requires a long time to
season. It has been ascertained, that of woods seasoned
by these methods, those dried soonest that had been
steamed; but the drying in either case should be somewhat
gradual, and four hours are generally sufficient for
the boiling or steaming process. The question of time
will depend upon circumstances: some persons consider
that one hour should be allowed for every inch in thickness.
In some dockyards, salt water is used in the boilers,
in others fresh, from considerations of convenience; and
the fact is, plank boiled in salt water never gets rid of the
salts that naturally enter the pores of the wood in boiling;
and such being the case, the ship in which this plank is
used is much more liable to the effects of damp than she
would have been if the plank had been boiled in fresh
water.</p>

<p>Boiling and steaming are likewise employed for softening
woods, to facilitate the cutting as well as bending of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
them. Thus, in Taylor’s patent machines for making
casks, the blocks intended for the staves are cut out of
white Canada oak to the size of 30 inches by 5 inches
and smaller. They are well steamed, and then sliced into
pieces ½ inch or ⅝ inch thick, at the rate of 200 in each
minute, by a process far more rapid and economical than
sawing; the instrument being a revolving iron plate of
12 feet diameter, with two radial knives arranged somewhat
like the irons of an ordinary plane or spokeshave.</p>

<p>How far steaming or boiling affects the durability of
timber has not been satisfactorily ascertained; but it is
said that the planks of a ship near the bows, which are
bent by steaming, have never been observed to be affected
with dry rot. With respect to boiling, Du Hamel’s
opinion is not favourable as to its adding to the durability
of timber; for when a piece of dry wood was immersed in
boiling water, and afterwards dried in a stove, it not only
lost the water it had imbibed, but also a part of its substance;
and when the experiment was repeated with the
same piece of wood, it lost more of its substance the second
time than it did the first. Tredgold&mdash;no mean authority&mdash;considers
that “boiled or steamed timber shrinks less,
and stands better than that which is naturally seasoned.”
Barlow is of opinion that “the seasoning goes on more
rapidly after the piece is steamed than when boiled.”</p>

<p>At the close of the Crimean and Baltic campaigns the
port of Cherbourg was almost completely cleared of staves
sufficiently seasoned for making casks. The engineer at
the head of the coopering department determined to boil
in fresh water the newly-cut staves, and compare the time
of their seasoning with that of other staves cut from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
same forests, but not prepared; and the result was that
after four or five months’ exposure to the atmosphere, the
boiled staves were perfectly fit for working up, while to
bring the others to the same point fifteen months were
barely sufficient.</p>

<p>Steaming is understood to prevent dry rot. No doubt
boiling and steaming partly remove the ferment spores,
but <i>may not</i> destroy the vitality of those remaining. For,
according to Milne-Edwards, on ‘Spontaneous Generation.’
he has seen tardigrades resist the prolonged action of a
temperature of 248° Fahr., and has known them to survive
a temperature of 284° Fahr. That low forms of
vegetation are fully as tenacious of life cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>Boiling and steaming also coagulate the albumen at
140° Fahr. Although coagulated albumen is insoluble in
water, the water solution is by this heating process sealed
up in the wood, and the cohesion of the latter is said to be
diminished.</p>

<p>The first essays in the art of drying wood artificially
carry us back to a period now tolerably remote. Wollaston
and Fourcroy both recommended the drying of wood in
ovens. Newmann, a German chemist, suggested another
method, which has since been adopted in a somewhat
different form, i. e. <i>steaming</i> the wood. Newmann placed
the wood to be dried in a large wooden chest, taking care
to leave spaces between the pieces, and then turned on
the steam from a boiler provided for the purpose. The
condensed steam, charged with albuminous matter taken
up from the wood, or rather from its surface, was run off
from time to time, and the process of the operation was
judged by the colour of the water. When the latter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
clear and colourless the chest was opened, and the wood
withdrawn for use without further preparation. The process
would have been useful enough if <i>superheated</i> steam,
which would have dried the wood by absorbing the
moisture, could have been used, but the cost of the process
would doubtless have been too high to permit of its
practical application.</p>

<p>In 1837, M. de Mecquenem devised a method of desiccation,
in which the pieces of wood to be dried were placed
in a closed chamber, and subjected to a current of hot air,
heated for the purpose by a special apparatus, and driven
by a blower. The air entered by apertures in the lower
part of the chambers, and escaped at the top laden with
the moisture absorbed from the wood.</p>

<p>In 1839, M. Charpentier obtained a <i>brévet d’invention</i>
for a process of drying wood in hermetically-closed
chambers. The wood was subjected to the action of air
heated by contact with metal plates covering the flue of
a coke furnace. This air entered by conduits on the level
of the floor of the chamber, and escaped at the top through
apertures leading into the chimney of the furnace.</p>

<p>In the same year, M. Saint Preuve invented a process
for forcing steam into pores of the wood, and, by condensation
of this steam in the pores, sucking in a preservative
preparation.</p>

<p>In 1847, MM. Brochard and Watteau’s process was
introduced. It consists simply of filling the cylinder
with steam, and making a vacuum by forcing in a cold
solution of salt, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The plan which has been for some years in use in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
England is the injection, by means of a ventilator, of hot air
into the drying stove where the wood is placed: by this the
temperature is gently and gradually raised until it reaches
boiling heat. But, as wood is one of the worst conductors
known of caloric, if this plan is applied to large logs,
the interior fibres still retain their original bulk, while
those near the surface have a tendency to shrink; the consequence
of which would be cracks and splits of more or
less depth.</p>

<p>Timber may be dried by passing rapid currents of
heated air through it under pressure. This plan was
carried out with the timber used for the floorings of the
Coal Exchange, London. The wood was taken in its
natural state, and in less than ten days it was thoroughly
seasoned. In some cases, from 10 to 48 per cent. of
moisture was taken out of the wood, and although the
floorings have now been down a great many years, it is
stated that very little shrinkage has been found, except in
the case of a few pieces which were put down in the latter
portion of the work, and which had not been submitted to
the seasoning process.</p>

<p>The process of desiccation, patented by Messrs. Davison
and Symington, in 1844, is of great practical value in
reducing the time requisite for seasoning timber. It is
peculiarly applicable to the seasoning of flooring boards
and of the wood used in joiners’ work. Care must be
exercised when removing the timber from the stove to the
building in which it is to be used, that it be not exposed
to the wet, nor even to a damp atmosphere for any
lengthened period. The advantage of this process over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the ordinary stoving consists in the temperature never
being so high as to scorch the wood, by which the
strength of the fibres would be injured; and in the facility
for removing the vapour as fast as it is expelled from the
wood, in consequence of the air being propelled through
the stove at any required velocity and temperature. As
compared with furnace and steam-stoving ordinarily
employed to desiccate woods, the great superiority of this
process is established by its seasoning the wood quite as
rapidly, but much more thoroughly; and instead of wood
being rendered brittle, as it is to some extent by stoving,
this mode does not reduce the strength and tenacity of
the wood. The principle of the invention is propelled
currents of heated air; but the heat has to be regulated
according to the texture of the various woods. Honduras
mahogany might be exposed to a heat of 300°, and the
whole of the moisture can be taken out in three days.
Timber 9 inches square is considered by Mr. Davison a
proper size for his invention. This process is described as
“A method or methods of drying, seasoning, and hardening
wood, and other articles, parts of which are also
applicable to the desiccation of vegetable substances
generally.” The first or principal part of the invention
consists in drying, seasoning, and hardening wood and
other articles&mdash;among which other articles are included
generally all things made of wood, or chiefly of wood&mdash;by
means, as has been stated, of rapid currents of heated
air. The manner in which these currents of heated air
are produced, is by an apparatus consisting of a furnace
and a series of pipes withinside of a core of brickwork.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
On each side of the furnace, on a level with the fire-bars,
is a horizontal tube; communicating and springing from
these tubes are a series of eighteen tubes placed vertically
and parallel to each other over the furnace. The outer
end of one of the horizontal tubes communicates with a
fan or other impelling apparatus for driving a constant
stream of atmospheric air through the tubes. As the air
passes through the tubes it becomes heated at a high
temperature, and rushes out at the farther end of the
other horizontal tube, and is thus conveyed to the place
where it is applied. The materials to be subjected to the
heated currents, such as logs, deals, &amp;c., by outward application,
must be placed in closed chambers, galleries,
vaults, or flues, which are to be of any suitable form or
magnitude; but it is recommended that they should be
made of fire-brick, and have double doors or shutters for
introducing or removing the wood. Honourable Mention
was made of Messrs. Davison and Symington’s process of
desiccation, by the jury, Class IV., Exhibition of 1851,
England.</p>

<p>Some amusing instances are related of the efficiency of
Davison and Symington’s process. Thus, a violin had
been in the owner’s possession for upwards of sixteen
years; how old it was when he first had it is not known.
Upon being exposed to this process it lost, in eight hours,
no less than five-sixths (nearly five and two-thirds) per
cent. of its own weight. This there is every reason to
believe was owing to the blocks glued inside, for the
purpose of holding the more slender parts together. A
violin maker of high reputation, having an order to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
an instrument for one of the first violinists of the day,
was requested to have the wood seasoned by this process;
only three days were allowed for the experiment, in which
the wood was seasoned and sent home. The two heaviest
pieces were reduced in weight 2½ lbs. It is ascertained
that, by this means of drying, the effect of age has been
given to the instrument made from the above wood, and
it was, in 1848, <i>first fiddle</i> in the orchestra of Her
Majesty’s Theatre, London. The wood had been in the
possession of its owners for eight years, and it was sent
from Switzerland, in the first instance, as <i>dry wood</i>.</p>

<p>In proof of the value of this invention for the manufacture
and cleansing of brewers’ casks, it was stated, in 1848,
that since its adoption at Trueman’s brewery, Spitalfields,
a saving of 300 tons of coals has been effected annually.</p>

<p>Flues or chambers for the heated air may be constructed
in parallel lines, either in the floors or upright
walls of a building, having narrow openings through
which the heated air may issue in thin streams, and
spread itself over the surface of the wood. If the
openings are in the floor, the wood will require to be
placed in an upright position; but if admitted in a
horizontal direction, standards and skeleton shelves will
be necessary to lay it upon. The great object, in all cases,
is to bring the heated air as speedily as possible into contact
with the wood, and to allow it, after it has done its
office, to pass away as speedily.</p>

<p>Furnaces and apparatus for the production of rapid
currents of heated air may be erected to prepare any
quantity of timber or articles of wood at one time, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
care should be taken that whatever the size of the outlet
may be from the series of pipes or vessels by which the
heat is generated, an outlet of at least equal dimensions is
left for the free exit of the air and the vapours thrown off.
It should also be observed, in constructing the open space
in the floor or upright walls for the stream of heated air to
pass towards the timber, that the superficial area of the
whole of them combined does not exceed the dimensions
of the principal outlet of the pipes at the extremity of
the furnace, so that a free current of heated air may be
allowed to pass uniformly throughout the chambers containing
the wood to be prepared. The temperature proper
to be given to the air, and velocity to the current in each
case, will depend on the size, density, and maturity of the
wood to be acted upon. The inventors found by their
experiments that wood generally may be advantageously
subjected to currents of air raised to a temperature of 400°
Fahr., when the currents are impelled at the rate of 100
feet per second. But when the wood is in a green state, it
is better to commence at a lower temperature, say from
150° to 200°, and gradually raise it to the high degree
before stated, as the desiccation proceeds, an object which
may, in some cases, be facilitated by carrying a cold-air
drain from the fanner or other propelling apparatus, and
attaching a damper to it, so that any quantity of cold air
required to reduce the temperature of the hot current
may, from time to time, be admitted. When, again, the
wood is in the log or unconverted state, it should be bored
or augured out in the centre, and the current of hot air
caused to traverse it as well interiorly as exteriorly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
whereby much time will be saved in the process of
desiccation, and a more uniform result obtained.</p>

<p>Woods treated in this manner, and with the above
modifications when requisite, part rapidly with their
natural sap and any other aqueous matter which they
may contain, and the fibres are brought closer together.</p>

<p>With respect to the time required to season the wood
upon this plan, much must depend upon the original state
of dryness it may be in, as well as the quality and
temperature of the heated air forced into contact with it.
It may suffice to remark that the wood may safely remain
thus exposed till any escape of moisture ceases to be
perceptible. This may be readily known, either by
applying a mirror or any polished surface to the outlet, or
by calculating the quantity of moisture removed from the
wood, which will be found to range between ¼ and ⅟12th of
its whole weight. For the purpose of ascertaining more
correctly the amount of moisture removed from time to
time, when the wood is placed in seasoning chambers as
already described, an opening should be constructed in
the chamber, in any convenient position, through which a
specimen of the wood may be withdrawn and weighed.</p>

<p>Between 1848 and 1853, Mr. Bethell, who had paid
much attention to the subject, obtained several patents,
both in England and France, for stoves for drying wood.
In his English patent of 1848, and the subsequent French
one of 1853, we find a description of a peculiar kind of
stove, on the following plan:</p>

<p>It consisted of a rectangular chamber formed of three
walls and vaulted over, the whole in brickwork, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
certain thickness of slag in the centre, to prevent loss of
heat. One extremity of the chamber was open to admit
of the introduction of the wood by means of a truck
running upon longitudinal iron rails. The opening was
closed with a double door when the chamber was full. On
the exterior of the opposite end of the chamber was a
furnace to burn coal, coke, wood, or tar, according as it
was desired to <i>dry</i> the wood simply, or, in the words of
the inventor, to <i>smoke</i> it, i. e., to impregnate it with the
antiseptic gaseous matters evolved in the imperfect combustion
of certain tarry substances. The heated air or
smoke entered through a flue running along the floor and
branching at the end, and it escaped, or was pumped out,
at the top of the vaults. Bethell considered that the
interior of the chamber should be kept at a temperature
of 110° Fahr., and that the duration of the process should
be regulated by the condition of the wood. His experiments
showed that this time varied from eight to twelve
hours, the rapidity being attained at the cost of a relatively
large expenditure of fuel. In point of fact, the draught
was too great to permit of the utilization of the full
amount of heat contained in the gaseous matter, which
escaped at a temperature very little below that at which
it entered. The heat produced by the fuel was badly
utilized, and it is open to question whether, under any
circumstances, large pieces of wood, such as sleepers,
could be dried in so short a time as eight or twelve hours.
The drying could only be effected by the use of a very
high degree of temperature, tending to split the wood and
weaken its strength. This view was confirmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
results obtained in a long series of experiments made, in
1852-3, by an English manufacturing company, known as
the Desiccating Company. A low temperature, and long
continuance of the drying process, appear to be the conditions
essential to the success of artificial desiccation,
particularly with wood intended for cabinet-making,
turning, joinery, ornamental work, &amp;c., in which it is
desirable, as far as possible, to prevent splitting, warping,
and other changes of structure in the material. These
results, it would seem, were not secured by the arrangements
above described.</p>

<p>Some years since, a stove was constructed for Messrs. S.
and J. Holme, very extensive builders at Liverpool, for
the purpose of drying timber for floors, and other fittings
of houses, &amp;c., by the application of Messrs. Price and
Manby’s patent warming apparatus; the want of seasoned
timber, with the great number of men they employed,
being a serious inconvenience and loss. In their large
undertakings Messrs. Holme found a difficulty in keeping
a stock of dry timber. The dimensions of the stove in
which the timber was to be dried was 43 feet long, 11 feet
wide, and 17 feet 6 inches high, and the cost of the apparatus
was about 150<i>l</i>. It was calculated to hold about
30,000 superficial feet of 1-inch boards, which, upon the
steam-pipe system, occupied full three weeks in drying.
This apparatus of Messrs. Price and Manby, with rather
less fuel, was considered to thoroughly dry each stove-full
in ten days, thus saving a consumption of ten days’ fuel,
independent of the advantages of expediting business.
The average temperature was 104°, and as the continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
stream of pure air passing between the metallic plates
was divested of its moisture, it carried off the dampness
of the timber in an imperceptible manner. An experiment
was tried, by having a flooring batten, 7 inches by
1¼ inch, cut from a piece of timber which had been
floated, and was as full of water as it could be, placed in
the stove; and when the temperature was 102°, it remained
there five days, and when sawn down into ⅝ inch
thick, and planed, it was found to be perfectly dry
throughout. The heat was so gentle, and the evaporation
so equal, that the timber was never rent, as when exposed
to the air and a hot sun: in short, Messrs. Holme considered
it one of the most perfect timber stoves that had
been made.</p>

<p>It may be remarked with respect to desiccation, that
the timber to be artificially dried is generally exposed to
a great heat for a short time, rather than to a moderate
heat for a lengthened one; and the air, saturated with the
vapour thus produced, is generally very imperfectly
removed. Wood so treated is almost sure to split, from
the unequal contraction to which it is exposed; and the
pores are also very liable to reopen on the wood being
withdrawn from the stove, because there is no gradual
and permanent change in their mechanical structure. It
is only within the last few years past that the artificial
desiccation of wood, before its impregnation with an antiseptic
preparation in closed vessels, has been frequently
adopted in practice.</p>

<p>We cannot give a better termination to the few remarks
we have made about “steaming and boiling timber,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
than by quoting the opinion of the late Sir Charles
Barry, R.A., architect to the new Houses of Parliament,
which we propose doing in the following manner:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">York Road, Lambeth,</span> <i>Nov. 30, 1844</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>In reply to your application, we beg to acquaint
you that we are willing to undertake the ordinary works
required in the finishings of the new Palace of Westminster. …
The wainscot to be used in the joiner’s
work is assumed to be from the best Crown Riga wainscot
in the logs, and from pipe-staves of the best quality,
in equal proportions, to be <i>prepared for use by steaming</i>,
or otherwise.…</p>

<p class="right"><i>Grissell &amp; Peto.</i>”</p>

<p class="noindent">Charles Barry, Esq.</p>

</div>

<p>Sir Charles Barry recommended this tender to the
Treasury for acceptance; but we fancy that he was
doubtful about the efficacy of steaming, as we think will
appear from the following extract from an “Agreement
between Sir Charles Barry and Messrs. Grissell and Peto,
builders:</p>

<p>“<i>First.</i> That the wainscot is assumed to be from the
log and pipe-staves in equal quantities; the prime cost of
which, in inch boards, <i>seasoned by steam</i>, or other artificial
means, so as to be fit for use, is calculated at 6½<i>d.</i> per foot
superficial.</p>

<p>“<i>Secondly.</i> That <i>if it should be found necessary to make
use of thoroughly dry wainscot boards</i> for the whole or any
portion of the joiner’s work, seasoned by natural means
(viz. exposure to the atmosphere), the prime cost of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
boards, with the addition of a profit of 7½ per cent., is to
be allowed for them, over and above the price of 6½<i>d.</i> per
foot superficial, the prime cost of wainscot boards provided
for in the contract, as above stated.” (Italics are our own.)</p>

<h3>SEASONING BY SMOKE DRYING.</h3>

<p>Smoke drying in an open chamber, or the burning of
furze, fern, shavings, or straw under the wood, is said to
give it hardness and durability; and, by rendering it
bitter, destroys and prevents worms. It also destroys the
germ of any fungus which may have commenced. It is
an old and well-founded observation that smoke drying
contributes much to the hardness and durability of woods.
Virgil appears to have been aware of its utility, when he
wrote the passage which is thus translated by Dryden:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Of beech, the plough-tail, and the bending yoke,</div>
<div class="verse">Or softer linden, hardened in the smoke.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Georgics</span>, i., 225.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beckman, in his ‘History of Inventions,’ quotes a passage
from Hesiod to the same effect; and adds, “as the
houses of the ancients were so smoky, it may be easily
comprehended how, by means of smoke, they could dry
and harden pieces of timber.” In this manner were prepared
the pieces of wood destined for ploughs, waggons,
and the rudders of vessels:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“These long suspend, where smoke their strength explores,</div>
<div class="verse">And seasons into use, and binds their pores.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Virgil.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The late Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham
bestowed much time and attention in endeavouring to
ascertain the quickest and best means of drying oak. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
his letter to the Navy Board, 6th March, 1812, he says:
“By exposing block shells to the smoke of burning wood,
they become in the course of two or three days well seasoned
in every respect, hard, bright coloured, and, as it
were, polished. But it was found in a very short time that
the acid with which the shells were thus impregnated
very rapidly corroded the iron pins which passed through
them.</p>

<p>“In Russia many small articles, such as parts of wheels,
wheel carriages, and sledges, are prepared in this manner;
so are wheels, at least in some parts of America; and
sabots and other small articles in France.”</p>

<p>In speaking of artificial heat, he says, in the same
letter:</p>

<p>“From all the opportunities I have had of examining
the state of timber so prepared by artificial heat, the due
seasoning without cracking has appeared to depend on
the ventilation happening to be <i>constant</i>, but very <i>slow</i>,
joined to such a due regulation of the heat as that the
<i>interior</i> of the timber should dry, and keep pace in its
contraction with the outer circles.”</p>

<p>Mr. T. W. Silloway, in ‘American Carpentry,’ remarks:
“If timber be dried by heat, the outside will become
hardened, and the pores closed, so that moisture, instead
of passing out, will be retained within.”</p>

<p>Bowden remarks, “that the timbers of a small ship
underwent the process of charring, either by suspending
them over a fire of chips, or by burning the exterior with
red-hot irons, so as to char the external surface. Air
trunks were also formed between the timbers, for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of evaporating moisture. The state of this vessel
was examined five years after she was launched, and it
appeared that, although the timbers had been very strongly
charred, fungi had grown to a considerable extent on both
sides abaft the fore channels, and that the plank near the
magazine was completely decayed.” <i>The power of vegetation
broke through the incrusted barrier against external
affection.</i></p>

<p>A method is in operation at Tourlaville, near Cherbourg,
for which the inventor, M. Guibert, has taken out
a patent, and it is said to give at once more expeditious
and sure results than those obtained from the use of dry
and hot air. It consists in filling the drying-stove with
smoke, produced by the distillation of certain combustible
matters, such as sawdust, waste tan, and smiths’ coals, &amp;c.
By means of a ventilator, ingeniously arranged, a rotatory
movement round the logs laid to season is given to the
smoke, so as to obtain an average uniform temperature in
every part. By this plan, as the distillation of combustibles
is always attended with a considerable discharge of
steam, all cracks and splits are said to be prevented.</p>

<p>There is much force in Sir Samuel Bentham’s observations
respecting the drying of timber by artificial heat:
it is certainly not well to attempt to dry it <i>too</i> quickly, for
if it be subjected to great heat, a large portion of the
carbon will pass off, and thereby weaken the timber.
Timber too suddenly dried cracks badly, and is thus
materially injured: planks of larch or beech are liable to
warp and twist if their drying is hastened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h3>STOVE DRYING.</h3>

<p>In some of the large manufactories for cabinet work,
the premises are heated by steam pipes, in which case
they have a close stove in every workshop heated many
degrees beyond the general temperature, for giving the
final seasoning to the wood; for heating the cauls; and
for warming the glue, which is then done by opening a
small steam pipe into the outer vessel of the glue-pot.
The arrangement is extremely clean, safe from fire, and
the degree of heat is very much under control.</p>

<p>In some manufactories, the wood is placed for a few
days before it is worked up in a drying-room heated by
means of stoves, steam or hot water, to several degrees
beyond the temperature to which the finished work is
likely to be subjected. Such rooms are frequently made
as air-tight as possible, which appears to be a mistake,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
as the wood is then surrounded by a warm but stagnant
atmosphere, which retains whatever moisture it may have
evaporated from the wood.</p>

<p>Fire-stoves for drying the timber were placed in the
magazine, bread-room, and other parts of the ‘Royal
Charlotte’ ship; and the evil of this practice was soon
shown, for the vessel became dry rotten in <i>twelve months</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Wood sometimes undergoes a baking process for
veneering. Fourcroy has recommended baking timber
in an oven, and he has asserted that it would render
timber more durable; “but,” says Boyden, “it should
be subjected to a very strong heat, lest in endeavouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to prevent vegetation, we should give it birth.” Captain
Shaw<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> observes: “Any artificial heating which burns the
air is most injurious to wood and all combustible materials,
and renders them much more inflammable than
they would be if only exposed to the temperature of the
atmosphere.”</p>

<h3>SEASONING BY SCORCHING AND CHARRING.</h3>

<p>Scorching and charring are good for preventing and
destroying infection in timber, but have to be done
slowly, and only to timber that is already thoroughly
seasoned; otherwise, by incrusting the surface, the evaporation
of any internal moisture is intercepted, and decay
in the heart soon ensues; if done hastily, cracks are also
caused on the surface, and which, receiving from the wood
a moisture for which there is not a sufficient means of
evaporation, renders it soon liable to decay. Charring
has little or no control over internal corruption, though it
is a good preventive against external infection: it increases
the durability of dry, but promotes the decay of
wet timber. Farmers very often resort to this method
for the preservation of their fence-posts; the charring
should extend a little above their contact with the
ground. Unless they discriminate between green and
unseasoned timber, these operations will prove injurious
instead of beneficial.</p>

<p>We have already quoted Sir Charles Barry in favour of
<i>steaming</i> wood; we now intend giving the opinion of a
former pupil of his with regard to <i>charring</i> it. Mr. George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Vulliamy, architect to the Metropolitan Board of Works,
in a specification for oak fencing which was fixed round
the boundaries of Finsbury Park, London, in 1867, writes
as follows:&mdash;“Dig out the ground for the upright standards
where shall be directed, and fill in and ram round same
with dry burnt earth, stones, and rubbish (the burnt clay
will be provided); enclose the boundaries of Park, as
shall be directed, with <i>dry and well-seasoned</i> heart of
English oak, <i>wrought</i> upright standards, 6 inches by
5 inches, and 8 feet 6 inches total length, with cut and
<i>splayed</i> tops, holes drilled for oak pins, and mortised for
horizontal rails, as shown on detailed drawings; to stand
5 feet 3 inches out of ground, and <i>the ends in ground to
be well charred before fixing</i>.” (The italics are our own.)</p>

<p>Our ancestors used charcoal and charred wood, on
account of their durability, for landmarks in the ground
between estates. The incorruptibility of charcoal is well
known. Amongst other advantages, rats will not touch
it; neither will the white ants nor cockroaches, so
common in the Indies, commit their depredations where
charring has been employed.</p>

<p>The ‘Revue Horticole’ states that it has been proved by
recent experiments, that the best mode of prolonging the
duration of wood is to char it, and then paint it over with
three or four coats of pitch. Many of the sleepers now laid
down on the Belgian railways are charred, the engineers
preferring this process to any other.</p>

<p>The superficial carbonization, or charring of wood, as a
preservative means, has long been practised. The Venetians
have used charring for timber for a long period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
particularly for piles. In France, M. de Lapparent
recently proposed to apply it to the timber used in the
French Navy. Some experiments, which were undertaken
with a view to determine its practicability, terminated
satisfactorily; and the Minister of Marine ordered the
process to be introduced into the Imperial dockyards.</p>

<p>M. de Lapparent makes use of a gas blowpipe, the
flame from which is allowed to play upon every part of
the piece of timber in succession. By this means the
degree of torrefaction may be regulated at will. The
method is applicable to woodwork of all kinds; and the
charring, it is said, does not destroy the sharpness of
any mouldings with which the wood may be ornamented.</p>

<p>In the ‘Journal des Savants,’ Feb. 15, 1666, appears
the following: “The Portugals scorch their ships, insomuch
that in the quick works there is a coaly crust of
about an inch thick; but this is dangerous, it happening,
not seldom, that the whole vessel is burnt.” It is no wonder
that the Portuguese ships should frequently fire in the
operation, as their plank was charred an inch deep. A
mere charring, if done properly, after the timbers had
been thoroughly seasoned by air, would have been
sufficient.</p>

<p>Charring seasoned wood is known to be a most effectual
mode of preservation against rot in timber: thus do piles,
when charred, last for ages in water or moist soil. Charred
wood has been dug up, which must have lain in the ground
for 1500 years, and was then found perfectly sound. After
the Temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was destroyed, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
found to have been built on charred piles; and at Herculaneum,
after 2000 years, the charred wood was found to
be whole and undiminished. But we find Sir Christopher
Wren did not approve of charred piles, except in a soil
where they would be constantly wet. So, in order to
attain a firmer foundation for St. Paul’s Cathedral, he had
the ground excavated to an immense depth before a stone
of the building was laid.</p>

<p>From time immemorial it has been the practice, particularly
in France, to burn the ends of the poles driven
into the ground to preserve them from decay. According
to the remark of the celebrated Carlomb, we should
always take into serious consideration old and well-known
customs; but in this instance it is easy to admit the
preserving effect of carbonization. Mr. James Randall,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Architect, states that he “oxidated several pieces of wood
with nitric acid, and with fire,” and these processes were
attended with success. Nearly the last sentence in his
work is, “<i>oxidation only</i> can be relied on, in all cases, as
an effectual cure.”</p>

<p>In charring, the surface of the timber is subjected to
a considerable heat, the primary effect of which is to
exhaust the sap of the epidermis, and to dry up the
fermenting principles. Here this is done by long exposure
to the air; and, in the second place, below the outside
layer completely carbonized, a scorched surface is found,
that is to say, partly distilled and impregnated with the
products of that distillation, which is creosoted; the
antiseptic properties of which are well known.</p>

<p>When Mr. Binmer was examined before the Commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of Woods, Forests, &amp;c., in 1792, he stated “that
all steamed plank should be afterwards dried and <i>burnt</i> to
extract the moisture.”</p>

<p>To a spontaneous carbonization must be attributed also
the unchangeableness of that timber entirely black, which
is met with everywhere in digging up the ground, where
it has laid buried for ages. In the neighbourhood of
St. Malo, France, these specimens are very common, and
there most of the espaliers and vine props are made of
wood, black as ebony, and famous for its durability. They
have been cut from the trees of an old forest, submerged
in the eighth century by an inroad of the sea, which formerly
crossed a Roman road, leading from Brittany to
Cotentin.</p>

<p>Not long after the beginning of the eighteenth century,
the method of heating or charring timber, before it
was worked up, and also that of stoving&mdash;that is, of
heating in kilns with sand&mdash;were practised in the Royal
dockyards. The ‘Royal William,’ one of the most
remarkable instances of durability that the British Navy
has supplied, was built either wholly or in part of timber
that had been charred. It was launched in 1719; never
repaired until 1757; and then, when surveyed afloat, in
1785, it appeared that the thick stuff and plank had been
<i>burnt</i> instead of being <i>kilned</i>; and that the ends of the
beams, the faying parts of the breast-hooks, crutches,
resters, knees, &amp;c., had been gouged in a manner then
practised, which was called <i>snail-creeping</i>; by means of
which the air was conveyed to the different parts of the
ship.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason this method has not been persevered in, but
nearly abandoned, is owing to many causes: the difficulty
and danger of the means adopted for charring, when
either straw, fern, or shavings are made use of; the
serious objection of burning the timber too deeply; or the
encumbrance of the apparatus, and the length of time
occupied, if sand-kilns sufficiently heated are used; and,
finally, to indifference, or that system of routine, against
which the wisest plans often contend in vain.</p>

<p>In house-building, the charring process should be
applied to the beams and joists embedded in the walls, or
surrounded with plaster; to the joists of stables, washhouses,
&amp;c., which, although exposed to the free air, are
constantly surrounded by a warm and moist atmosphere,
an active cause of fermentation; to the wainscotting of
ground floors; to the flooring beneath parquet work; to
the joints of tongues and rabbets; for carbonization by
means of gas still leaves to the wood, for working purposes,
all the sharpness of its edges. Charring is particularly
useful in the junction of all broad surfaces, and more
essentially in those which are cut either transverse or
oblique to the grain of the wood, as the sap vessels are
then exposed to the absorption of moisture. The butts of
timbers are peculiarly liable to rot, because of affording a
lodgment for moisture without a free passage for air. No
seasoned timber should have its tubular parts exposed,
nor should any timber have the saw marks upon it,
because the torn filaments absorb and retain moisture.
Allusion has already been made to the process adopted,
near Cherbourg, for preventing the decay of timber by
means of gas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>By carbonization, a practical and economical means is
afforded to railway companies of preserving, almost for
ever, the sleepers, and particularly oak, which cannot be
impregnated easily by the injection of mineral salts. Let
us suppose, for instance, that after, say ten or fifteen years,
the sleepers on a line are taken up for the length of a
mile, and replaced by new ones; the old, when rasped and
burnt again, will serve for the replacing the following
mile, and so on, one mile after the other. It might be
equally serviceable to apply the same process to injected
beech, for the reason that it is almost impossible to make
the preserving liquid penetrate thoroughly the mass of the
timber.</p>

<h3>SEASONING BY EXTRACTION OF SAP.</h3>

<p>Mr. John Stephen Langton’s method of seasoning by
extraction of the sap was patented in 1825, but is now
almost wholly discontinued. It consists in letting the
timber into vertical iron cylinders, standing in a cistern
of water, closing the cylinders at top; and the water
being heated, and steam used to produce a partial vacuum,
the sap relieved from the atmospheric pressure oozes from
the wood, and being converted into vapour, passes off
through a pipe provided for the purpose. The time
required is about ten weeks, and the cost is about ten
shillings per load; but the sap is wholly extracted, and
the timber is said to be fit and ready for any purpose;
the diminution of weight is, with a little more shrinkage,
similar to that in seasoning by the common natural
process.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Barlow’s patent provided for exhausting the air
from one end of the log while one or more atmospheres
press upon the other end. This artificial aerial circulation
through the wood is prolonged at pleasure. However
excellent in theory, this process is not practicable.</p>

<p>In October, 1844, M. Tissier proposed to place wood
in a close vessel, and subject it to a current of hot dry
air; and in 1847, Mr. Miller proposed to inject hot air
through beams of wood to drive out the sap.</p>

<p>In 1851, M. Meyer d’Uslaw proposed to first dilate the
pores of the wood with steam, and then place it in a
hermetically closed chamber, and make a vacuum there.</p>

<p>The following system of preparing timber for the Navy
was, not many years since, adopted in South Russia. A
full account of the practice will be found in Oliphant’s
‘Russian Shores of the Black Sea,’ 1853. The only
name we can give it is</p>

<h3>“‘SEASONING’ BY BRIBES.”</h3>

<p>A certain quantity of well-seasoned oak being required,
Government issues tenders for the supply of the requisite
amount. A number of contractors submit their tenders
to a board appointed for the purpose of receiving them, who
are regulated in the choice of a contractor not by the
amount of his tender, but of his bribe. The <i>fortunate</i>
individual selected immediately sub-contracts upon a
somewhat similar principle. Arranging to be supplied
with the timber for half the amount of his tender, the
sub-contractor carries on the game, and perhaps the eighth
link in this contracting chain is the man who, for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
absurdly low figure, undertakes to produce the <i>seasoned</i>
wood.</p>

<p>His agents in the central provinces accordingly float
a quantity of green pines and firs down the Dnieper and
Bog to Nicholaeff, which are duly handed up to the head
contractor, each man pocketing the difference between his
contract and that of his neighbour. When the wood is
produced before the board appointed to inspect it, another
bribe <i>seasons</i> it; and the Government, after paying the
price of well-seasoned oak, is surprised that the 120-gun
ship, which it has been built of it, is unfit for service in
five years.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Mark but my fall, and that that ruin’d me,</div>
<div class="verse">Corruption.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shakspeare.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A few words can only be given to a most important
matter, viz., the <i>second seasoning</i>, which many woods
require. If floor-boards are only laid down at first on the
joists of a building, and at the expiration of one year
wedged tight and nailed down, those unsightly openings
caused by shrinkage, which form a harbour for dirt and
vermin, will be avoided, as the wood will have had an
opportunity of shrinking. Doors, sashes, architraves in
long lengths, will also be better if made up some time
before they are required for use. Many Indian woods
require a second seasoning&mdash;kara mardá, for instance, a
favourite wood with Indian railway engineers. Even sál
and teak are not exempt. Teak shrinks sideways least of
all woods. In the ‘Tortoise,’ store ship, when fifty years
old, no openings were found to exist between the boards;
yet Colonel Lloyd says he found the teak timbers used by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
him in constructing a large room in the Mauritius to have
shrunk ¾ of an inch in 38 feet. Thus a space of ⅜ of an
inch must have been left at each end of the beam, where
moisture could lodge and fungi exist, obtaining their
nourishment from the wood. If unseasoned teak is used
for ships, dry rot will in time find a place. It may be
said that teak is a very hard wood, and very durable;
yet “the mills of the gods,” says an ancient philosopher,
“grind slow, very slow, but they grind to powder;” <i>and
so do the fungi mills</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON SEASONING TIMBER BY PATENT PROCESSES, ETC.</span></h2>

<p>Long years of practical experience has shown that timber,
however prone to dry or wet rot, may be preserved from
both by the use of certain metallic solutions, or other
suitable protective matters.</p>

<p>All the various processes may be said somewhat to
reduce the transverse strength of the timber when dry,
and the metallic salts are affected at the iron bolts or
fastenings. The natural juices of some woods do this;
and bolts which have united beams of elm and pitch pine
will often corrode entirely away at the junction.</p>

<p>The processes adopted for resisting the chemical changes
in the tissues of the wood are all founded on the principle
that it is essential to inject some material which shall
at once precipitate the coaguable portion of the albumen
retained in the tissues of the wood in a permanent insoluble
form, so that it will not hereafter be susceptible
of putrefactive decomposition. For this purpose, many
substances, many solutions, have been employed with
variable success, but materials have been sometimes introduced
for this purpose which produced an effect just
the opposite to what was anticipated.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that timber is permeable, at least
by aqueous solutions, only so long as the sap channels are
free from incrustation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Such in general is the case with beech, elm, poplar, and
hornbeam, the capillary tubes of which are always open,
or, at least, close very slowly. At the same time it may
be said that there must remain ever in these species some
parts impervious to injection, whilst it is almost impossible
but that a certain portion of the fibres will be more or less
incrusted. The sap woods, on the other hand, of every
species appear quite pervious.</p>

<p>Very little is known of any preservative process adopted
in ancient times. Pliny observes that the ancients used
garlic boiled in vinegar with considerable success, especially
with reference to preserving timber from worms:
he also states that the oil of cedar will protect any timber
anointed with it from worm and rottenness. Oil of cedar
was used by the ancient Egyptians for preserving their
mummies. Tar and linseed oil were also recommended by
him. The image of the goddess Diana, at Ephesus, was
saturated with olive and cedar oils; also the image of
Jupiter, at Rome; and the statues of Minerva and Bacchus
were impregnated with oil of spikenard.</p>

<p>The idea of preserving wood by the action of oil is
therefore by no means new; but it is somewhat curious
that the earliest modern processes should also be by
means of oil. The <i>oils most proper</i> to be used are <i>linseed</i>,
<i>rapeseed</i>, or almost any of the vegetable fixed oils. Oak
wood, rendered entirely free from moisture, and then
immersed in linseed oil, is said to be thus prevented from
splitting: the time of immersion depending on the size, &amp;c.
Palm oil is preferable to whale oil, because impregnation
with the latter, although in many instances eligible, causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
wood to become brittle. It is, however, probable that
whale oil, when combined with other substances, such as
litharge, coal pitch, or charcoal, may lose much of that
effect. As cocoa-nut oil, which is, under low temperature,
like the oil expressed from the nuts of the palm tree, is
known to be highly preservative of timber and metallic
fastenings, we may expect the same result from the latter,
and thereby avoid that extreme dryness and brittleness
of the timber which Mr. Strange complained of in the
Venetian ships that had been seasoned for many years in
frame under cover. Cocoa-nut oil beat up with shell lime
or <i>chunam</i>, so as to become putty, and afterwards diluted
with more oil, is used at Bombay and elsewhere as a
preservative coat or varnish to plank. It cannot become
a varnish without the addition of some essential oil; and
the oil of mustard is used; which, of course, will produce
the desired effect. In the first volume of the Abbé
Raynal, on the European settlements in the East and
West Indies, he mentions that an oil was exported from
Pegu for the preservation of ships; but as he does not
say what oil, no conclusion can be drawn further than as to
the probability of its being one of those already noticed.</p>

<p>Experience has proved that even <i>animal oils</i> are so far
injurious to timber as to <i>render it brittle</i>, whilst they
preserve it from rottenness; and that, on the other hand, a
mineral salt more or less combined with fatty substances
does not produce that effect. The staves of whale-oil
casks become quite brittle, whilst those of beef, pork, and
tallow barrels remain tough and sound. Ships <i>constantly</i>
in the Greenland trade have their timbers and planks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
preserved so far as they have become impregnated with
whale oil.</p>

<p>Experiments with fish oil prove that of itself, unless
exposed to sun and air, it may be injurious; that it
loosens the cohesion of timber; but that <i>animal fat</i>, combined
<i>with saline matter</i>, <i>is preservative</i>.</p>

<p>Fish oil used alone is ineligible, because capable of
running into the putrefactive process, unless as a thin
outside varnish. In hard, sound timber, it will hardly
enter at all; and if poured into bore-holes in the heads of
timbers, it will insinuate itself into the smallest rents or
cracks, and waste through them. Used alone, or with
any admixture, it is absorbed and dried quickly on wood
in a decomposing state or commencing to be dry rotten.
Used with litharge, it dries after some days; but with
lamp-black it has scarcely so much tendency to dry as
when used alone. Paint of fish oil and charcoal dries
very quickly where there is absorption, and the charcoal
extends its oxidating or drying effect to the fish oil in
its vicinity.</p>

<p>We give the following to prove what we have written,
and also to serve as an example for those who wish to try
experiments:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">EXPERIMENTS ON FISH OIL.</p>

<p>June 9.&mdash;Upon a piece of old oak scantling, with its alburnam on one
side in a state of decay, fish oil was poured several times, viz. on this day,
on June 25, and July 3, which it rapidly absorbed in the decayed part.</p>

<p>July 26.&mdash;It was payed (or mopped) with fish oil and charcoal powder,
and the following day it was put under an inverted cask.</p>

<p>October 1.&mdash;The end of this piece was covered with a greenish mould.
<i>This proves that fish oil must be injurious, except where exposed to sun and air
to dry it.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>A compound of fixed oils and charcoal is liable to
inflame, but as a thin covering or pigment it may not
be so.</p>

<p>The <i>petroleum</i> oil-wells, near Prome, in Burmah, have
been in use from time immemorial. Wood, both for
ship-building and house-building, is invariably saturated
or coated with the product of those wells; and it is stated
that the result is <i>entire immunity from decay</i> and the
ravages of the white ant. At Marseilles, and some other
ports in the Mediterranean, it used to be the practice to
run the petroleum, which is obtained near the banks of
the Rhone, into the vacancies between the timbers of the
vessels, to give them durability. It was sometimes, for
the conjoint purpose of giving stability and duration to
vessels, mixed with coarse sand or other extraneous
matters, and run in whilst hot between the ceiling and
bottom plank, where it filled up the vacancies between
the timbers in the round of their bottoms, excepting
where necessary to be prevented. The great objection
to the use of petroleum is its inflammability. <i>Creosote</i>, its
great rival for wood preserving, is also inflammable, and
not so agreeable in colour; but it is <i>considerably cheaper</i>,
which is an important matter.</p>

<p>As we are now about to enter upon the subject of patent
processes, &amp;c., it appears desirable to lay down certain
principles at the commencement, in order to assist the
reader as much as possible.</p>

<p>Almost every chemical principle or compound of any
plausibility has been suggested in the course of the last
hundred and fifty years; but the multiplicity and contradiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of opinions form nearly an inextricable labyrinth.
To commence.</p>

<p>1st. It seems obvious that <i>the sooner the sap is wholly
removed from the wood the better</i>, <i>provided the woody fibre
solidifies without injury</i>.</p>

<p>2nd. That <i>the wood should be impregnated with any
strongly antiseptic and non-deliquescent matter</i>, <i>which must
necessarily be in solution when it enters the wood</i>. No deliquescent
remedy is eligible, because moisture is injurious
to metallic fastenings.</p>

<p>3rd. <i>The wood should be first dried, and its pores then
closed with any substance impervious to air and moisture,
and at the same time highly repellant to putrescency.</i> The
most essential requisites in a preservative of timber being
a disposition to <i>dryness</i>, and a tendency to resist <i>combustion</i>
as far as consistently obtainable.</p>

<p>4th. <i>Any process to be successful ought not to be tedious,
very difficult, or too expensive.</i> These are important
elements in the success of any patent.</p>

<p>Very little is known of any preservative process previous
to the year 1717, when directions were given by the Navy
authorities to <i>boil</i> treenails, and dry them before they
were used. But whether the custom had prevailed before
this time, or whether their strength and durability were
increased by it, there are no means of ascertaining. It
does not appear that any substance was put into the
water to decompose the juices; but as they are soluble in
warm water, perhaps the power of vegetation might have
been destroyed without it.</p>

<p>In 1737 Mr. Emerson patented a process of saturating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
timber with <i>boiled oil</i>, mixed with poisonous substances;
but his process was very little used. This, we believe,
was the <i>first</i> patent on wood preserving.</p>

<p>About 1740, Mr. Reid proposed to arrest decay by means
of a certain <i>vegetable acid</i> (probably pyroligneous acid).
The method of using it was by simple immersion.</p>

<p>In 1756, Dr. Hales recommended that the planks at
the water-line of ships should be soaked in <i>linseed oil</i>, to
prevent the injury to which wood is subject when alternately
exposed to wet and dry; and indeed, many ships
were built in which a hollow place was cut in one end of
each beam or sternpost, which might constantly be kept
filled with <i>train oil</i>. Amongst other ships so constructed,
the ‘Fame,’ 74, may be mentioned. When, after some
years, this ship was repaired, it was found that as far as
the oil had penetrated, namely, from 12 to 18 inches from
the end, the wood was quite sound, whilst the other parts
were more or less decayed. The Americans used to hollow
out the tops of their masts in the form of cups or basins;
bore holes from the end a considerable way down the
masts; pour oil into these; cover them over with lead;
and leave the oil to find its way down the capillary vessels
to the interior of the timber.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In 1769, Mr. Jackson, a London chemist, with a view
to the prevention of decay, obtained permission to prepare
some timber to be used in the national yards, by immersing
it in a solution of <i>salt water</i>, <i>lime</i>, <i>muriate of soda</i>,
<i>potash</i>, <i>salts</i>, &amp;c., the result of which dose was, that several
frigates in the Navy subjected to the process were rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
more perishable than if they had been constructed of unprepared
timber. The solution was filtered into the wood
partly by means of holes made in it. Chapman proposed
a similar method of preserving the frames of ships, viz. by
boring holes in the timbers, and pumping a <i>solution of
copperas</i> in water into them. He believed every part of
the vessel would thus be impregnated.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson also prepared the frame of the ship ‘Intrepid’
with another solution. The ship lasted many
years. Bowden thought it was a <i>solution of glue</i>. Chapman
suggested <i>slaked lime</i>, thinned with a weak <i>solution of
glue</i> for mopping the timbers of a ship.</p>

<p>Shortly after Mr. Jackson’s process was started, Mr.
Lewis attempted to accomplish the preservation of timber
by placing it surrounded by pounded lime, in spaces below
the “surface of the earth.” The use of lime has also been
advocated by Mr. Knowles, Secretary of the Committee of
Surveyors of the Navy, who has written an able work on
the ‘Means to be taken to Preserve the British Navy
from Dry Rot’ (1821).</p>

<p>Between 1768 and 1773 a practice prevailed of saturating
ships with common salt; but this was found to cause a
rapid corrosion of the iron fastenings, and to fill the vessels
between decks with a constant damp vapour. In ‘Nicholson’s
Journal,’ No. 30, there is an article signed <i>Nauticus</i>
on this subject. Vessel owners had long ago observed that
those ships which have early sailed with cargoes of salt
are not attacked by dry rot. Indeed, several instances are
attested of vessels whose interiors were lined with fungi
having all traces of the plant destroyed by accidental or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
intentional sinking in the sea. Acting on such hints, a
trader of Boston, U. S., salted his ships with 500 bushels
of the chloride, disposed as an interior lining, adding 100
bushels at the end of two years. Such an addition of dead
weight is sufficient objection to a procedure which has
other great disadvantages. Salt should never be applied
as an antidote against the dry rot, on account of its natural
powers of attracting moisture from the atmosphere, which
would render apartments almost uninhabitable, from their
continual dampness. Those who have lived for any length
of time in a house at the sea-side, the mortar of which has
been partly composed of sea sand, will have observed
the moist state of the paper, plastering, &amp;c., in wet
weather. Bricks made with sea sand are objectionable.</p>

<p><i>Salt water</i> seasoning has already been referred to in the
last chapter, but as it is so closely connected with salt
seasoning, the further and final consideration of salt water
seasoning may be fitly dealt with here. Salt water will not
extract the juices from the timber like fresh water. It is
only by destroying the vegetation that salt water can be
advantageous, but it would require a very long time to impregnate
large timber to the heart so as to destroy vegetation.
It is well known that wood is softened, and in time
decomposed, by extreme moisture. Fifty years since, the
master builder at Cronstadt complained that the oak from
Casan, which was frequently wet from different causes in its
passage of three years to Cronstadt, was so water-soaked as
never to dry; and also from the information of Mr. Strange,
it appears “that the practice at Venice of the fresh-cut
timber being thrown into salt water, prevents its ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
becoming dry in the ships, and that the salt water rusted
and corroded the iron bolts.” In fine, vessels built with
salt water seasoned wood are perfect hygrometers, being as
sensible to the changes of the moisture of the atmosphere
as lumps of rock salt, or the plaster of inside walls where
sea sand has been used.</p>

<p>In Ceylon, the timber of the female palm tree is much
harder and blacker than that of the male, inasmuch as it
brings nearly triple its price. The natives are so well
aware of the difference that they resort to the devise of
immersing the male tree in <i>salt water</i> to deepen its colour,
as well as add to its weight.</p>

<p>Vessels impregnated with <i>bay salt</i>, or the large grained
salt of Leamington or of Liverpool (pure muriate of soda),
will possess decided advantages; as also will vessels that
have been laden with <i>saltpetre</i>, if it has been dispersed
amongst their timbers.</p>

<p>Ships (the timbers of which had been previously immersed
in salt water) have been broken up after a few
years’ service, and the floor timbers taken out quite sound:
but when exposed to the sun and rain in the summer
months, their albumen has been in a decomposed or
friable state.</p>

<p>By the answers to queries given to Mr. Strange, the
British Minister at Venice, in or about 1792, it appears
that several of the Venetian ships of war had then lain
under sheds for fifty-nine years; some in bare frames, and
others planked and caulked: that these ships show no
outward marks of decay; but their timbers have shrunk
much, and <i>become brittle</i>; that some of the most intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
ship builders were of opinion that great prejudice had
arisen from the prevalent custom of throwing the timber
fresh cut into salt water, and letting it lie there until
wanted; that afterwards it dried, and withered on the
outside, under the sheds, while the inside, being soaked
with salt water, rotted before it became dry; and this was
one reason, amongst others, why Venetian ships, though
built of good timber, lasted so short a time; for the salt
moisture not only rots the inside of the beams and timbers,
but of course rusts and corrodes the iron bolts.</p>

<p><i>Salt water</i>, <i>sea-sand</i>, and <i>sea-weed</i> are now used for
seasoning “jarrah” wood in Western Australia. This
wood is considered a first-class wood for ship-building, but
it is somewhat slow to season, and if exposed before being
seasoned it is apt to “fly” and cast. The method adopted is
as follows: The logs are thrown into the sea, and left there
for a few weeks; they are then drawn up through the sand,
and after being covered with sea-weed a few inches deep,
are left to lie on the beach, care being taken to prevent
the sun getting at their ends. The logs are then left for
many months to season. When taken up they are cut
into boards 7 inches wide, and stacked, so as to admit of a
free circulation of air round them, for five or six months
before using them. Sea-weed or sea-ware, cast upon the
shores, contains a small quantity of carbonate of soda, and
a large proportion of nitrogenous and saline matters, with
earthy salts, in a readily decomposable state. They also
contain much soluble mucilage. The practice of seasoning
timber by heating it in a <i>sand bath</i> was formerly adopted
by the Dutch, and by the Russians in building boats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Mr. Thomas Nichols (in a letter to Lord Chatham, when
First Lord of the Admiralty) states “that the same end,
viz. preservation of timber from decay, might probably
be acquired by burying the timber in sand, which acts as
an artificial sap,” in the same manner as mentioned in
Townsend’s ‘Travels through Spain,’ to be used with the
masts of ships of war at Cadiz.</p>

<p><i>Peat moss</i> has been recommended (because the sulphates
of iron, soda, and magnesia are found in it), but it failed
when tried.</p>

<p>With reference to Mr. Lewis’s proposal to preserve wood
by means of lime, it must be remembered that <i>quicklime</i>,
with damp, has been found to accelerate putrefaction, in
consequence of its extracting carbon; but when dry, and
in such large quantities as to absorb all moisture from the
wood, <i>the wood is preserved</i>, <i>and the sap hardened</i>. Vessels
<i>long</i> in the lime trade have afforded proof of this fact;
and we have also examples in plastering-laths, which are
generally found sound and good in places where they have
been dry. Whitewash or <i>limewater</i> has been strongly
recommended for use between the decks of ships, as being
unfavourable to vegetation: it should be renewed at intervals
of time, according to circumstances. It has been
applied with good effect to the joists and sleepers of
kitchen floors; but to be effectual it should be occasionally
renewed. Effete, or re-carbonated lime, is injurious
to timber, like other absorbent earths; so also are calcareous
incrustations formed by the solution of lime in water,
as appears from Von Buch’s ‘Travels in Norway,’ in which
he says, “that in the fishing country (near Lofodden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
beyond the Arctic circle) the calcareous incrustations
brought by water, filtering through a bed of shells, soon
cause the vessels and wood to be covered with and destroyed
by green fungi.” The ends of joists of timber inserted in
walls are frequently found rotten; and where not so, it
may probably be owing to the mortar having been made
with hot lime, and used immediately, or to the absence of
moisture. It does not appear practicable to use limewater
to any extent for preserving timber, because water holds
in solution only about ⅟500th part of lime, which quantity
would be too inconsiderable; it, however, renders timber
more durable, but at the same time very hard and difficult
to be worked (p. 73).</p>

<p>Vessels constantly in the <i>coal</i> trade have generally required
little repair, and have lasted until in the common
course of things they were lost by shipwreck. This must
be owing to the martial pyrites which abound in all coals;
and also from the sulphuric acid arising from the quantity
of coal dust which finds its way through the seams of the
ceiling, and adheres to the timber and planks.</p>

<p>In 1779, M. Pallas, in Russia, proposed to steep wood
in <i>sulphate of iron</i> (green vitriol) until it had penetrated
deeply, <i>and</i> then in <i>lime</i> to precipitate the vitriol. Neumann,
in his first volume of ‘Chemistry,’ on the article
green vitriol, says, “That in the Swedish transactions this
salt is recommended for preserving wood, particularly the
wheels of carriages, from decay.</p>

<p>“When all the pieces are fit for being joined together,
they are directed to be boiled in a solution of vitriol for
three or four hours, and then kept for some days in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
warm place to dry. It is said that the wood by this preparation
becomes so hard and compact that moisture cannot
penetrate it, and that iron nails are not so apt to be
destroyed in this vitriolated wood as might be expected,
<i>but last as long as the wood itself</i>.”</p>

<p>In 1780 the marcasite termed by the miners <i>mundic</i>,
found in great abundance in the tin mines in Devonshire
and Cornwall, was employed, in a state of fusion, to eradicate
present and to prevent the future growth of dry rot;
but whether its efficacy was proved by time is not known.
A garden walk where there are some pieces of mundic
never has any weeds growing; the rain that falls becomes
impregnated with its qualities, and in flowing through the
walk prevents vegetation.</p>

<p>In 1796 Hales proposed to <i>creosote</i> the treenails of ships:
this was forty-two years previous to Bethell’s patent for
creosoting wood.</p>

<p>About the year 1800, the Society of Arts’ building in the
Adelphi, London, being attacked by dry rot, Dr. Higgins
examined the timbers, caused some to be removed and
replaced by new, and the remainder to be scraped and
washed with a solution of <i>caustic ammonia</i>, so as by burning
the surface of the wood to prevent the growth of fungi.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the present century, a member
of the Royal Academy of Stockholm called attention
to the use of <i>alum</i> for preserving wood from fire. He
says, in the Memoirs of that Academy, “Having been
within these few years to visit the alum mines of Loswers,
in the province of Calmar, I took notice of some attempts
made to burn the old staves of tubs and pails that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
been used for the alum works. For this purpose they were
thrown into the furnace, but those pieces of wood which
had been <i>penetrated</i> by the alum did not burn, though
they remained for a long time in the fire, where they only
became red; however, at last they were consumed by the
intenseness of the heat, but they yielded no flame.” He
concludes, from this experiment, that wood or timber for
the purpose of building may be secured against the action
of fire by letting it remain for some time in water wherein
vitriol, alum, or any other salt has been dissolved which
contains no inflammable parts.</p>

<p>In Sir John Pringle’s Tables of the antiseptic powers of
different substances, he states <i>alum</i> to be thirty times
stronger than sea-salt; and by the experiments of the
author of the ‘Essai pour servir à l’Histoire de la Putréfaction,’
metallic salts are much more antiseptic than
those with earthy bases.</p>

<p>In 1815 it occurred to Mr. Wade that it would be a
good practice to fill the pores of timber with <i>alumine</i>,
or selenite; but two years after, Chapman observed,
“Impregnation of ships’ timbers with a <i>solution of alum</i>
occurred to me about twenty years since, because on immersion
in sea-water the alumine would be deposited in
the pores of the timber; but I was soon informed of its
worse than inutility, by learning that the <i>experiment had
been tried</i>, and, in place of preserving, had <i>caused the wood
to rot speedily</i>. Impregnation with <i>selenite</i> has been tried
in elm water-pipes. On precipitation from its solvent it
partially filled the pores, and hardened the wood, but <i>occasioned
speedy rottenness</i>.” If, by using a <i>solution of alum</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to render wood uninflammable, we at the same time cause
it to <i>rot speedily</i>, it becomes a question <i>whether the remedy
is not worse than the disease</i>. Captain E. M. Shaw, of the
London Fire Brigade, in his work, ‘Fire Surveys’ (1872),
recommends <i>alum and water</i>. Probably he only thought
of fire, and not of rotting the wood. The alum question
does not appear to be yet satisfactorily settled.</p>

<p>While upon the subject of uninflammable wood, we may
state that in 1848, upon Putney Heath (near London), by
the roadside, stood an obelisk, to record the success of a
discovery made in the last century of the means of building
a house which no ordinary application of ignited combustibles
could be made to consume: the obelisk was
erected in 1786. The inventor was Mr. David Hartley,
to whom the House of Commons voted 2500<i>l.</i>, to defray
the expenses of the experimental building, which stood
about one hundred yards from the obelisk. The building
was three stories high, and two rooms on a floor. In
1774, King George the Third and Queen Charlotte took
their breakfast in one of the rooms, while in the apartment
beneath fires were lighted on the floor, and various inflammable
materials were ignited to attest that the rooms above
were fire-proof. Hartley’s secret lay in the floors being
double, and there being interposed between the two
boards sheets of laminated iron and copper, not thicker
than stout paper, which rendered the floor air-tight and
thereby intercepted the ascent of the heated air; so that,
although the inferior boards were actually charred, the
metal prevented the combustion taking place in the upper
flooring. Six experiments were made by Mr. Hartley in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
this house in 1776, but we cannot ascertain any particulars
about them, or any advantages which accrued to the
public from the invention, although the Court of Common
Council awarded him the freedom of the City of London
for his successful experiments.</p>

<p>In 1805 Mr. Maconochie proposed to saturate with resinous
and oily matters inferior woods, and thus render them
more lasting. This proposal was practically carried out
in 1811 by Mr. Lukin, who constructed a peculiar stove
for the purpose of thus impregnating wood under the influence
of an increased temperature. The scheme, however,
had but very partial success, for either the heat was
too low and the wood was not thoroughly aired and seasoned,
or it was too high and the wood was more or less
scorched and burnt. Mr. Lukin buried wood in <i>pulverized
charcoal</i> in a heated oven, but the fibres were afterwards
discovered to have started from each other. He next
erected a large kiln in Woolwich dockyard, capable of
containing 250 loads of timber, but an explosion took
place on the first trial, before the process was complete,
which proved fatal to six of the workmen, and wounded
fourteen, two of whom shortly afterwards died. The
explosion was like the shock of an earthquake. It demolished
the wall of the dockyard, part of which was thrown
to the distance of 250 feet; an iron door weighing 280 lb.
was driven to the distance of 230 feet; and other parts of
the building were borne in the air upwards of 300 feet.
The experiment was not repeated.</p>

<p>Mr. Lukin was not so fortunate in 1811 as in 1808, for
in the latter year he received a considerable reward from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the Government for what was considered a successful
principle of ventilating hospital ships.</p>

<p>In 1815 Mr. Wade recommended the impregnation of
timber with resinous or oleaginous matter (preferring linseed
oil to whale oil) or with <i>common resin</i> dissolved in a
lixivium of <i>caustic alkali</i>, and that the timber should afterwards
be plunged into water acidulated with any cheap
acid, or with alum in solution. He considered that timber
impregnated with oil would not be disagreeable to rats,
worms, cockroaches, &amp;c., and that the contrary was the
case with resin. He also recommended the impregnation
of timber with sulphate of <i>copper, zinc, or iron</i>, rejecting
deliquescent salts, as they corrode metals.</p>

<p>In 1815 Mr. Ambrose Boydon, of the Navy Office,
strongly recommended that the timber, planks, and treenails
of ships should be first boiled in <i>limewater</i> to correct
the acid, and that they afterwards should be boiled in a
<i>thin solution of glue</i>, by which means the pores of the wood
would be filled with a hard substance insoluble by water,
which would not only give the timbers durability, by preventing
vegetation, but increase their strength. Glue, he
thought, might be used without limewater, or glue and
limewater mixed together.</p>

<p>In 1817 Mr. William Chapman published the result of
various experiments he had made on wood with <i>lime</i>, <i>soap</i>,
and <i>alkaline</i> and <i>mineral salts</i>. He recommended a solution
of a pound of <i>sulphate of copper</i> or blue vitriol (at
that time 7<i>d.</i> per pound) dissolved in four ale gallons of
rain water, and mopped on hot over all the infected parts,
or thrown over them in a plentiful libation. He also recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
one ounce of <i>corrosive sublimate</i> (then 6<i>s.</i> per
pound) to a gallon of rainwater applied in the same manner
to the infected parts. For weather-boarded buildings
he considered one or more coats of thin <i>coal tar</i>, combined
with a small portion of <i>palm oil</i>, for the purpose of
preventing their tendency to rend, to be a good preservative.</p>

<p>Messrs. Wade, Boydon, and Chapman published works
on dry rot about this time.</p>

<p>In 1822 Mr. Oxford took out a patent for an improved
method of preventing “decay of timber,” &amp;c. The process
proposed was as follows: “The essential <i>oil of tar</i> was
first extracted by distillation, and at the same time saturated
with <i>chlorine gas</i>. Proportions of <i>oxide of lead</i>,
<i>carbonate of lime</i>, and <i>carbon of purified coal tar</i> well
ground, were mixed with the oil, and the composition
was then applied in thick coatings to the substances intended
to be preserved.”</p>

<p>On 31st March, 1832, Mr. Kyan patented his process of
<i>corrosive sublimate</i> (solution of the <i>bi-chloride of mercury</i>)
for preventing dry rot; which process consisted as follows:
A solution of the corrosive sublimate is first made, and the
timber is placed in the tank. The wood is held down in
such a way, that when immersed on the fluid being pumped
in, it cannot rise, but is kept under the surface, there being
beams to retain it in its place. There it is left for a week,
after which the liquor is pumped off, and the wood is removed.
This being done, the timber is dried, and said to
be prepared. Sir Robert Smirke was one of the first to use
timber prepared by Kyan, in some buildings in the Temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
London; and he made some experiments on timber
which had undergone Kyan’s process. He says, “I took
a certain number of pieces of wood cut from the same log
of yellow pine, from poplar, and from the common Scotch
fir; these pieces I placed first in a cesspool, into which the
waters of the common sewers discharged themselves; they
remained there six months; they were then removed from
thence, and placed in a hotbed of compost under a garden-frame;
they remained there a second six months; they
were afterwards put into a flower border, placed half out
of the ground, and I gave my gardener directions to water
them whenever he watered the flowers; they remained
there a similar period of six months. I put them afterwards
into a cellar where there was some dampness, and
the air completely excluded; they remained there a fourth
period of six months, and were afterwards put into a very
wet cellar. Those pieces of wood which underwent
Kyan’s process are in the same state as when I first had
them, and all the others to which the process had not
been applied are more or less rotten, and the poplar is
wholly destroyed.</p>

<p>“I applied Kyan’s process to yellow Canadian pine
about three years ago, and exposed that wood to the
severest tests I could apply, and it remains uninjured,
when any other timber (oak or Baltic wood) would certainly
have decayed if exposed to the same trial, and not
prepared in that manner.</p>

<p>“As another example of the effect of the process, I
may mention that about two years ago, in a basement
story of some chambers in the Temple, London, the wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
flooring and the wood lining of the walls were entirely
decayed from the dampness of the ground and walls, and
to repair it under such circumstances was useless. As I
found it extremely difficult to prevent the dampness, I
recommended lining the walls and the floor with this prepared
wood, which was done; and about six weeks ago I
took down part of it to examine whether any of the wood
was injured, but it was found in as good a state as
when first put up. I did not find the nails more liable
to rust.’</p>

<p>“I have used Kyan’s process in a very considerable
quantity of paling nearly three years ago; that paling is
now in quite as good a state as it was, though it is partly
in the ground. It is yellow pine. Some that I put up
the year before, without using Kyan’s process (yellow pine),
not fixed in the ground, but close upon it, is decayed.”</p>

<p>This evidence, by such an experienced architect as the
late Sir Robert Smirke was, is certainly of great value in
favour of Kyan’s process.</p>

<p>The recorded evidence upon the efficiency of this mode
of treating timber for its preservation is somewhat contradictory.
On the Great Western Railway 40,000 loads
were prepared, at an expenditure of 1¾ lb. of sublimate
to each load, the timber, 7 inch, being immersed for a
period of eight days, and the uniformity of the strength of
the solution being constantly maintained by pumping.
Some samples of this timber, after six years’ use as
sleepers on the railway, were found “as sound as on the
day on which they were first put down.” This timber
was prepared by simple immersion only, without exhaustion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
or pressure. Some of the sleepers on the London
and Birmingham Railway, on the other hand, which had
been Kyanized three years only, were found absolutely
rotten, and Kyan’s process was there consequently
abandoned.</p>

<p>This process is said to cost an additional expense to
the owner of from fifteen to twenty shillings per load of
timber. Mr. Kyan at first used 1 lb. of the salt in 4
gallons of water, but it was found that the wood absorbed
4 or 5 lb. of this salt per load; more water was added to
lessen the expense, until the solution became so weak as
in a great measure to lose its effect.</p>

<p>Simple immersion being found imperfect as a means of
injecting the sublimate, attempts were afterwards made
to improve the efficiency of the solution by <i>forcing</i> it into
the wood. Closed tanks were substituted for the open
ones, and forcing pumps, &amp;c., were added to the apparatus.
The pressure applied equalled 100 lb. on the square inch.
With this arrangement a solution was made use of having
1 lb. of the sublimate to 2 gallons of water; and it was
found that three-fourths of this quantity sufficed for preparing
one load of timber. The timber was afterwards
tested, and it was ascertained that the solution had penetrated
to the heart of the logs. Mr. Thompson, the
Secretary to Kyan’s Company, stated, in March, 1842,
that experience had proved “that the strength of the
mixture should not be less than 1 lb. of sublimate to
15 gallons of water; and he had never found any well-authenticated
instance of timber decaying when it had
been properly prepared at that strength.” As much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
as 1 in 9 was not unfrequently used. Kyan’s process is
now but very rarely used; Messrs. Bethell, of King
William Street, London, adopt it when requested by their
customers. We have given the statements which have
been made for and against this patent, but after a lapse
of forty years it is difficult to reconcile conflicting
statements.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Kyan invented his process in 1832, Sir
Humphrey Davy had previously used and recommended
to the Admiralty, and Navy Board, a weak solution of
the same thing to be used as a wash where rot made its
appearance: on giving his opinion upon Mr. Lukin’s
process, that eminent chemist observed, “that he had
found corrosive sublimate highly antiseptic, and preservative
of animal and vegetable substances, and therefore
recommended rubbing the surface of timber with a solution
of it.” In 1821 Mr. Knowles, of the Navy Office,
referred to the use of corrosive sublimate for timber. In
fact, it was used in 1705, in Provence (France), for preserving
wood from beetles. Kyan, however, was the first
to apply it to any extent. In the years 1833 to 1836,
at the Arsenal, Woolwich, experiments were instituted,
having for their object the establishing, or otherwise, the
claims of Kyan’s system; the results of which were of a
satisfactory nature. Dr. Faraday has stated that the combination
of the materials used was not simply mechanical
but chemical; and Captain Alderson, C.E., having experimented
upon some specimens of ash and Christiana deal,
found that the rigidity of the timber was enhanced, but
its strength was in some measure impaired; its specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
gravity being also in some degree diminished.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Kyan’s
process is said by some to render the wood brittle.</p>

<p>Mr. Kyan considered that the commencement of rot
might be stopped or prevented by the application of
corrosive sublimate, in consequence of the chemical
combination which takes place between the corrosive sublimate
and those albuminous particles which Berzelius and
others of the highest authority consider to exist in and
form the essence of wood; which, being the first parts to
run to decay, cause others to decay with them. By
seasoning timber in the ordinary way, the destructive
principle is dried, and under common circumstances
rendered inert. But when the timber is afterwards
exposed to great moisture, &amp;c. (the fermentative principle
being soluble when merely dried), it will sometimes be
again called into action. Kyan’s process is said not only
altogether to destroy this principle and render it inert,
but, by making it solid and perfectly insoluble, to remove
it from the action of moisture altogether. It thus loses
its hygrometric properties, and, therefore, prepared or
patent seasoned timber is not liable to those changes of
atmosphere which affect that which is seasoned in the
common way. All woods, including mahogany and the
finest and most expensive wood, may be seasoned by
Kyan’s process in a very short space of time, instead of
the months required by the ordinary methods.</p>

<p>The reader will find a great deal about Kyan’s system
in the ‘Quarterly Review,’ April, 1833; and about proposals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
for using chloride of mercury for wood, ‘Memoirs of
the Academy of Dijon,’ 1767; ‘Bull. des Sciences teen.,’
v. ii., 1824, Paris; and ‘Bull. de Pharm.,’ v. 6, 1814, Paris.</p>

<p>It is well known that Canadian timber is much more
liable to decay than that grown in the northern parts of
Europe, and for this reason is never extensively used in
buildings of a superior description. The principle of decay
being destroyed by Kyan’s process as above described, this
objection no longer exists, and this kind of timber may
therefore now be employed with as great security as that
of a superior quality and higher price. The same observation
applies with great force to timber of British growth,
particularly to that of Scotland, much of which is considered
as of little or no value for durable purposes, on
account of its extreme liability to decay, whether in
exposed situations or otherwise. The process invented by
Kyan might therefore render of considerable value plantations
of larch, firs of all kinds, birch, elm, beech, ash,
poplar, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Cost of process in 1832, 1<i>l.</i> per load of 50 cubic feet of
timber.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Inwood, the architect of St. Pancras Church,
London, reported favourably of Kyan’s process. On 22nd
February, 1833, Professor Faraday delivered a lecture at
the Royal Institution, London, on Kyanizing timber; and
on 17th April, 1837, he reported that Kyan’s process
had not caused any rusting or oxidation of the iron in
the ship ‘Samuel Enderby,’ after the ship had been
subjected to this process, and had been on a three years’
voyage to the South Sea fisheries; and in the same year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
viz. 1837, Dr. Dickson delivered a lecture at the Royal
Institute of British Architects on dry rot, recommending
Kyan’s process.</p>

<p>Five years after Mr. Kyan’s invention, viz. in 1837, a
Mr. Flocton invented a process for preventing decay, by
saturating timber with <i>wood-tar</i> and <i>acetate of iron</i>, but
little is known of this invention: we believe it was a
failure.</p>

<p>During the same year Mr. Flocton’s process was made
known, a Frenchman named Letellier recommended
saturating timber in a solution of <i>corrosive sublimate</i>, and
when dry, into one of <i>glue</i>, <i>size</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>During this year Mr. Margary took out his patent for
applying <i>sulphate of copper</i> to wood. We propose to describe
Margary’s process further on: we do not think he
received any medals for it.</p>

<p>We now arrive at the modern <i>creosoting</i> process, which
was brought to perfection by the late Mr. John Bethell.
Mr. Bethell’s process of creosoting, or the injection of the
heavy oil of tar, was first patented by him on July 11th,
1838.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It consists in impregnating the wood throughout
with oil of tar, and other bituminous matters containing
creosote, and also with pyrolignite of iron, which holds
more creosote in solution than any other watery menstruum.
Creosote, now so extensively used in preserving
wood, is obtained from coal tar, which, when submitted
to distillation, is found to consist of pitch, essential oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
(creosote), naphtha, ammonia, &amp;c. In the application
of the oil of tar for this purpose, it is now considered
to be indispensable that the ammonia be got rid of;
otherwise the wood sometimes becomes brown and decays,
as may be constantly seen in wood coated with
the common oil tar. The kind of creosote preferred
by continental engineers and chemists, and also by the
late Mr. John Bethell himself, is <i>thick</i>, and rich in <i>naphthaline</i>.
Some English chemists now seem to prefer the
thinnest oil, which contains no naphthaline, but a little
more carbolic acid; the crude carbolic acid would vary
from 5 to 15 per cent.: no engineer has ever required
more than 5 per cent. of crude carbolic acid in creosote.
The thinner oil appears to be more likely to be drawn
out of the wood by the heat of the sun or absorption in
powdery soil, and is more readily dissolved out by moisture.</p>

<p>Mummies many thousands of years old have evidently
been preserved on the creosoting principle, and from
observing the mummies the process of creosoting suggested
itself to Mr. Bethell. The ancient Egyptians,
whether from the peculiarity of their religious opinions,
or from the desire to shun destruction and gain perpetuity
even for their dead bodies, prepared the corpses of
their deceased friends in a particular way, viz. by coagulating
the albumen of the various fluids of the body by
means of creosote, cedar oil, salt, and other substances,
and also by excluding the air. How perfectly this
method has preserved them the occasional opening of a
mummy permits us to see. A good account of the operation
is given in the chapter on mummies, in the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
volume of Egyptian Antiquities in the ‘Library of Entertaining
Knowledge.’</p>

<p>By the process of creosoting the timber is rendered
more durable, and less liable to the attack of worms; but
it becomes very inflammable; that is, <i>when</i> once alight
burns quickly; in addition to which, the disagreeable
odour from timber so treated renders it objectionable for
being used in the building of dwelling-houses.</p>

<p>The action of the solutions in water of metallic salts
is, if the mixture is sufficiently strong, to coagulate the
albumen in the sap; but the fibre is left unprotected.</p>

<p>Creosote has the same effect of coagulating the albumen,
whilst it fills the pores of the wood with a bituminous
asphaltic substance, which gives a waterproof
covering to the fibre, prevents the absorption of water,
and is obnoxious to animal life.</p>

<p>In cases where the complete preservation of timber is
of vital importance, and expense not a consideration, the
wood should be first subjected to Burnett’s process, and
then creosoted; by which means it would be nearly indestructible;
the reason for this combined process being,
that the albumen or sap absorbs the creosote more readily
than the heart of the timber, which can, however, be
penetrated by the solution of chloride of zinc. Mr. John
Bethell’s patent of 1853 recommends this in a rather
improved form. He says the timber should <i>first</i> be
injected with metallic salts, then dried in a drying-house,
then creosoted. By this method, very considerable quantities
both of metallic salt and creosote can be injected
into timber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been stated that the elasticity of wood is increased
by creosoting; the heart-wood only decays by
oxidation.</p>

<p>The wood should be dried previous to undergoing the
process, as the sapwood, otherwise almost useless, can be
rendered serviceable, and for piles for marine work whole
round timber should be used, because the sapwood is
so much more readily saturated with the oil, and this
prevents the worms from making an inroad into the
heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Bethell uses about 10 lb. of creosote per cubic
foot of wood, and he does not allow a piece of timber to
be sent from his works without being tested to ascertain
if it has absorbed that amount, or an amount previously
agreed upon. We mention the latter statement, because
it is evident that all descriptions of wood cannot be made
to imbibe the same amount. This process is chiefly used
for pine timber: yellow pine should absorb about 11 lb.
to the cubic foot, and Riga pine about 9 lb. The quantity
of oil recommended by the patentee, engineers, and
others, is from 8 to 10 lb. for land purposes, and about
12 lb. to the cubic foot for marine. In this country, for
marine the quantity does not exceed 12 lb.; but on the
Continent, in France, Belgium, and Holland, the quantity
used is from 14 to 22 lb. (!) per cubic foot. The specifications
frequently issued by engineers for sleepers for
foreign railways describe them to be entirely of heart-wood,
and then to be creosoted to the extent of 10 lb. of
the oil per cubic foot: this it is impossible to do, the value
of the process being in the retention of the sapwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It being ascertained a few years since that the centres
of some sleepers were not impregnated with the fluid,
after the sleeper had been creosoted to the extent of
10 lb. of creosote per cubic foot, Sir Macdonald Stephenson
suggested, as a means of obviating that defect, the
boring of two holes, 1 inch in diameter, through each
sleeper longitudinally, and impregnating up to 12 lb. or
14 lb. per cubic foot. By that means the creosote would
be sent all through the sleeper. The boring by hand
would be an expensive process, but by machinery it might
be effected at a comparatively small increased cost.</p>

<p>During the last twenty-five years an enormous quantity
of creosoted railway sleepers have been sent to India and
other hot climates. The native woods are generally too
hard for penetration. On the great Indian Peninsula
Railway the native woods were so hard and close-grained
that they could not be impregnated with any preservative
substance, sál wood being principally used, into which
creosote would not penetrate more than one quarter of an
inch. As regards creosoting wood in India, it is moreover
a costly process, owing to the difficulty and expense of
conveying creosote from England; iron tanks are necessary
to hold the oil when on board ship, and, being
unsaleable in India, add to the expense.</p>

<p>English contractors often send piles to be creosoted
which have been taken from the timber docks. The large
quantity of water they contain resists the entrance of the
oil, and the result is that a great deal of timber is badly
prepared because the contractors cannot obtain it dry.</p>

<p>In the best creosoting works the tank or cylinder is about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
6 feet diameter, and from 20 to 50 feet long. In some
instances cylinders are open at both ends, and closed with
iron doors, so that sleepers or timber entered at one end
on being treated can be delivered finished at the opposite
end; but for all practical purposes one open end is sufficient,
as the oil when heated being of such a searching
character it is a difficult matter to get the doors perfectly
air-tight, consequently they are apt to leak during the
time the pressure is being applied. Pipes are led from
the cylinder to the air and force pumps; the air is not
only extracted from the interior of the cylinder, but also
from the pores of the timber. When a vacuum is made,
the oil, which is contained in a tank below the cylinder,
is allowed to rush in, and, as soon as the cylinder is full, the
inlet pipe is shut and the pressure pumps started to force
the oil into the wood; the pressure maintained is from
150 to 200 lb. to the square inch, until the wood has
absorbed the required quantity of oil, which is learned by
an index gauge fixed to the working tank below. All
cylinders are fitted with safety valves, which allow the oil
not immediately absorbed to pass again into the tank.
The oil is heated by coils of pipe placed in the tank,
through which a current of steam is passed from end to
end, raising the temperature to 120°.</p>

<p>With regard to the cost of creosoting: half-round
sleepers, being 9 feet long, 10 inches wide, and 5 inches
thick, properly creosoted, are worth about 4<i>s.</i> each; adzing
for the chairs (done by machine) costs 6<i>s.</i> per 100. These
prices, unfortunately, vary very much, according to circumstances.
The fir sleepers on the London and Birmingham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Railway cost 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, and the patent preservative
added 9<i>d.</i> more to the expense, but they did not cost so
much on other lines. A London builder wrote to us in
1870, as follows: “Our price for creosoting timber, &amp;c.,
is 15<i>s.</i> per load of 50 cubic feet. Price of creosote, 2<i>d.</i>
per gallon.”</p>

<p>By returns from the Leith Harbour Works it was
shown that the average quantity of creosote absorbed by
the timber was 57⅞ gallons per load, or 577 lb. weight
forced into 50 cubic feet of wood. Assuming the cost to
be 15<i>s.</i> per load, and the creosote at 2<i>d.</i> per gallon, the
creosote would cost 9<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and the labour and profit
5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per load of 50 cubic feet.</p>

<p>It is essential to observe that all methods of protecting
timber depend for their success upon the skilful and conscientious
manner in which they are applied; for, as they
involve chemical actions on a large scale, their efficiency
must depend upon the observance of the minute practical
precautions required to exclude any disturbing causes.
In the case of creosoting: to distil the creosote, to draw
the sap or other moisture from the wood, and subsequently
to inject the creosote in a proper manner, it is necessary
that the operations should be carried into effect under the
supervision of experienced persons of high character.</p>

<p>Mr. Bethell’s process has been and still is being tested
on the Indian railways. According to Dr. Cleghorn, it
appears that many of the creosoted sleepers have, however,
“been found decayed in the centre, the interior
portion being scooped out, leaving nothing but a deceptive
shell, in some instances not more than ½ inch in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
thickness,” but he does not state whether the sleepers
were prepared in England or in India; because, if prepared
in India, it is probable that some of the hard Indian
woods, into which it is not possible to get creosote or any
other preservative fluid, had been used. Mr. Burt, who
has large timber-preserving works in London for creosoting,
stated about eight years since, that after an experience
of twenty years, during which time he had sent over one
million and a half sleepers to India alone, besides having
prepared many thousand loads of timber for other purposes,
he could safely assert that the instances of failure
had been rare and isolated.</p>

<p>A section of a piece of timber impregnated with creosote
presents some curious and very distinctive characteristics,
according to the duration of the process of injection and
amount of tar injected. In every case the injected tar
follows the lines and sinuosities of the longitudinal fibres.
When injected in sufficient quantity it fills the pores
altogether; when, on the contrary, the process has been
incompletely performed, which, however, is generally sufficient,
the tar accumulates in the transverse sections, and
plugs the channels that give access to deleterious agents.</p>

<p>The experiments made by M. Melseuns on oaken blocks
exposed to the fumes of <i>liquid ammonia</i> show that the
conservating fluids follow the precise course that would be
taken by decay. In wood treated with creosote the tar
acts on the very parts first exposed to injury, and on the
course that would be taken by decay, which is thus rendered
impossible. The methods of injection suggested
by M. Melseuns in 1845 did not answer equally well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with every kind of wood. After trying wooden blocks
in every sort of condition, dressed and in the rough,
green and dry, sound and decayed, M. Melseuns found
that alder, birch, beech, hornbeam, and willow were easily
and completely impregnated; deal sometimes resisted the
process, the innermost layers remaining white; poplar
and oak offered a very great resistance&mdash;indeed, with
poplar it was found necessary to repeat the process.</p>

<p>The decay of sleepers, prepared and unprepared, will
often depend on their form. Three forms have been used:
1st, the half-round sleeper, 10 inches by 5 inches;
these are now almost universally used; 2nd, the triangular
sleeper, about 12 inches wide on each side, used by Mr.
Cubitt on the Dover line, but since abandoned; and 3rd,
the half square, 14 inches by 7 inches, used by Mr. Brunel
and still in use. Mr. G. O. Maun, in reporting on the
state of the sleepers of the Pernambuco Railway, states
that fair average samples taken out on the 1st December,
1863 (laid in 1857), show that the half-round intermediate
sleeper is in the most perfect state of preservation; in fact,
nearly as good as on the day it was put down; while the
square-sawn or joint sleeper has not withstood the effects
of the climate so well.</p>

<p>The kind of ballast in which it will be most advisable
to lay the sleeper is another important point to be
attended to. About 12 miles of the Pernambuco Railway
are entirely laid with creosoted sleepers, principally in
white sand. In this description of ballast the half-round
sleepers have suffered, since the opening of the first section
of the line in 1858 up to 1866, a depreciation of not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
than 1 per cent., whilst the square-sawn sleepers have
experienced a depreciation of not less than 50 per cent.
Had the latter been placed in wet cuttings with ballast retentive
of moisture, no doubt the whole of them would have
required to be renewed. Hence it is evident that fine open
sand ballast, which allows a free drainage during the rains,
is best adapted for the preservation of sleepers in the tropics:
it has also been found to be the best in most countries.</p>

<p>The number of testimonials given in favour of creosote
is very large, and are from the most eminent engineers
of all countries, in addition to which Mr. Bethell has
received several medals at international exhibitions.
The English engineers include Messrs. Brunel, Gregory,
Abernethy, Ure, Hemans, Hawkshaw, and Cudworth; the
French, MM. Molinos and Forestier; the Dutch, Messrs.
Waldorp, Freem, and Von Baumhauer; and the Belgian,
M. Crepin. The late Mr. Brunel expressly stated that,
in his opinion, well creosoted timbers would be found in a
sound and serviceable condition at the expiration of forty
years. M. Forestier, French engineer of La Vendée department,
reporting to the juries of the French Exhibition
of 1867, cites a number of experiments he has lately tried
upon many pieces of creosoted and uncreosoted oak, elm,
ash, Swedish, Norwegian, and Dantzic red fir, Norway
white fir, plane, and poplar, and shows that in each case,
except that of the poplar, the resistance of the wood both
to bending and crushing weight was much increased by
creosoting.</p>

<p>Drs. Brande, Ure, and Letheby, also bear testimony to
the efficacy of this mode of preserving timber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Creosoting has been extensively employed upon all the
principal railways in Great Britain. In England, upon
the London and North Western, North Eastern, South
Eastern, Great Western, &amp;c. In Scotland, on the Caledonian,
Great Northern, &amp;c. In Ireland, on the Great
Southern and Western, Midland, &amp;c. It has also been
and is being employed in Belgium, Holland, France,
Prussia, India, and America.</p>

<p>Between the years 1838 and 1840, Sir William Burnett’s
(formerly Director-General of the Medical Department of
the Navy) process was first made known to the public.</p>

<p>This process consists of an injection of <i>chloride of zinc</i>
into timber, in the proportion of about 1 lb. of the salt to
about 9 or 10 gallons of water, forced into the wood
under a pressure of 150 lb. per square inch.</p>

<p>The late Professor Graham thus wrote of its efficiency:
“After making several experiments on wood prepared by
the solution of chloride of zinc for the purpose of preservation,
and having given the subject my best consideration,
I have come to the following conclusions:</p>

<p>“The wood appears to be fully and deeply penetrated
by the metallic salt. I have found it in the centre of a
large prepared block.</p>

<p>“The salt, although very soluble, does not leave the
wood easily when exposed to the weather, or buried in
dry or damp earth. It does not come to the surface of the
wood like the crystallizable salts. I have no doubt, indeed,
that the greater part of the salts will remain in the
wood for years, when employed for railway sleepers or
such purposes. This may be of material consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
when the wood is exposed to the attacks of insects, such
as the white ant in India, which, I believe, would be repelled
by the poisonous metallic salt. After being long
macerated in cold water, or even boiled in water, thin chips
of the prepared wood retain a sensible quantity of the
oxide of zinc; which I confirmed by Mr. Toplis’ test, and
observed that the wood can be permanently dyed from
being charged with a metallic mordant.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt, from repeated observations made
during several years, of the valuable preservative qualities
of the solution of chloride of zinc, as applied in Sir W.
Burnett’s process; and would refer its beneficial action
chiefly to the small quantity of the metallic salt, which
is permanently retained by the ligneous fibre in all circumstances
of exposure. The oxide of zinc appears to
alter and harden the fibre of the wood, and destroy the
solubility, and prevent the tendency to decomposition
of the azotised principles it contains by entering into
chemical combination with them.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Jury, which was drawn up by the
Count of Westphalia, at the Cologne International Agricultural
Exhibition, in 1865, upon prepared specimens of
timber, has the following remarks on the chloride of zinc
process:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1st. That chloride of zinc is the only substance which
thoroughly penetrates the timber, and is at the
same time the best adapted for its preservation.</p>

<p>2nd. That the process of impregnating the wood after
cutting is more useful and rational than doing so
while the tree is growing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>3rd. That red beech is the only wood which has
been impregnated in an uniform and thorough
manner.</p>

</div>

<p>It should, however, be stated that the Jury had very
slender evidence presented to it respecting the creosoting
process. The creosoted specimens had been impregnated
under the pressure of 60 lb. to 65 lb. per
square inch for three or four hours, and were consequently
inefficiently done; in England the pressure per square
inch would have been at least 140 lb.</p>

<p>Drs. Brande and Cooper, of England, and Dr. Cleghorn,
of India, also wrote favourably of Sir W. Burnett’s
process.</p>

<p>In 1847 a powerful cylinder, of Burnett’s construction,
hermetically closed, was laid down adjoining the sawmills
in Woolwich dockyard. It was found to admit the
largest description of timber for the purpose of having
the moisture extracted, and the pores filled with chloride
of zinc. Three specimens of wood&mdash;English oak, English
elm, and Dantzic fir&mdash;remained uninjured in the fungus
pit at Woolwich for five years; while similar, but unprepared,
specimens were all found more or less decayed.</p>

<p>The cost of preparing timber by this process is 12<i>s.</i> per
load, besides 2<i>s.</i> for landing and loading: 1 lb. of the
material costing 1<i>s.</i>, which is sufficient for 9 or 10 gallons
of water.</p>

<p>Sir W. Burnett and Co.’s works for hydraulic apparatus
and tanks are at Nelson Wharf, Millwall, Poplar; their
office is at 90, Cannon Street, London. Their terms
are&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For timber, round or square, including planks, deals, hop-poles, paving-blocks,
&amp;c., against rot, 12<i>s.</i> per load of 50 cubic feet.</p>

<p>“For park palings, cabinet work, wine and other laths, as per agreement.</p>

<p>“For railway sleepers, 9 feet long, 10 inches by 5 inches, landing and
reshipping included, 7<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<p>“For timber to be rendered uninflammable, 25<i>s.</i> per load.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sir W. Burnett’s firm now sell their patent concentrated
solution at 5<i>s.</i> per gallon: each gallon must be diluted
with 40 gallons of water, according to the instructions in
the licence, for which no charge is made.</p>

<p>The reader will probably have observed that this process
is <i>considered</i> to render timber uninflammable; then let us
see what will be the cost of obtaining a fire-proof house.</p>

<p>The principal building material which causes the destruction
of our houses by fire is wood&mdash;<i>combustible wood</i>.
If, therefore, (as nearly all our houses are “brick and
timber” erections,) we render this wood uninflammable,
what will the cost be?</p>

<p>The following is an <i>approximate</i> estimate of the extra
expense, including sundries, &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Although among the many attempts to preserve wood
those in England have proved the most successful, it
should be mentioned that France, Germany, and America
have given much attention to the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the last century Du Hamel and Buffon
pointed out the possibility of preserving wood, as well as
the means of rendering it unalterable. As early as 1758
Du Hamel made experiments on the vital suction of
plants, and made some curious observations on the different
rings of vegetable matter which absorb most liquid
in different plants. He also tried the effect of vital suction
and pressure (of gravitation) acting at the same time.
His process was reviewed by Barral in 1842.</p>

<p>About 1784 M. Migneron invented a process about
which little is now known, but the wood was covered with
certain fatty substances. Wood nine years exposed to
deterioration was improved by this process. M. Migneron
had the approval of Buffon, Franklin, and the Academies.
His invention was again brought into notice in 1807, when
it was found that timber which had been prepared by it in
1784, and exposed more than twenty years, was quite sound.</p>

<p>In 1811 Cadet de Gassicourt made different kinds of
wood imbibe vegetable and mineral substances, and certain
unguents: he used metallic salts (iron, tin, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>In 1813 M. Champy plunged wood into a bath of <i>tallow</i>
at 334°, and kept it there two or three hours. His experiments
were afterwards repeated by Mr. Payne.</p>

<p>About the year 1832 it was proposed in America to
apply <i>pyroligneous acid</i> to the surface of wood, or introduce
it by fumigation.</p>

<p>Biot (who has written an excellent life of Sir Isaac
Newton) remarked, in 1831, that wood could be soaked
by pressure; but his process of penetrating it with liquids
was imperfect, and his discovery remains unapplied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>A Frenchman, of the name of Bréant, made about this
time a discovery which preceded Boucherie’s method,
which is adopted to a great extent in France. Bréant’s
apparatus consisted of a very ingenious machine, which,
acting by pressure, caused liquids to penetrate to all points
of a mass of wood of great diameter and considerable
length. He may therefore be regarded as having solved
the problem of penetration in a scientific, though not in
a practically applied, point of view. Dr. Boucherie testified
before the Académie des Sciences, in 1840, to the
merit of Bréant’s invention, which, with modifications by
Payne, Brochard, and Gemini, has been worked in France
and England. This process was recommended by Payne
in 1840 and 1844, and imitated by him in France, and
later on by Yengat and Bauner, who used both <i>an air
pump and a forcing pump</i>. Bréant obtained three patents,
viz. 1st, in 1831, to act by pressure; 2nd, in 1837, by
vital suction: and 3rd, in 1838, vacuum by steam. A
mixture of linseed oil and resin succeeded best with him.
He attached more importance to the thorough penetration
of the wood than to the choice of the penetrating substances.
He borrowed his process from Du Hamel, but
to make the necessary suction in the pores he produces a
partial vacuum in the impregnating cylinder by filling it
with steam, and condensing the steam.</p>

<p>Previous to Boucherie’s method, a German, Frantz
Moll, in 1835, proposed to introduce into wood <i>creosote
in a state of vapour</i>, but the process was found to be too
expensive. This was a modification of Maconochie and
Lukin’s trials in 1805 and 1811.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> A similar process has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
since arisen in New York: we believe Mr. Renwick, of
that place, suggested it.</p>

<p>Such were the known labours, when Dr. Boucherie,
in December, 1837, devoted his time to a series of experiments
upon timber, with a view to discover some
preservative process which should answer the following
requirements: First, for protecting wood from dry rot or
wet rot; second, for increasing its hardness; third, for
preserving and developing its flexibility and elasticity;
fourth, for preventing its decay, and the fissures that
result from it, when, after having been used in construction,
it is left exposed to the variations of the atmosphere;
fifth, for giving it various and enduring colours and
odours; and sixth and last, for greatly reducing its inflammability.</p>

<p>It is a curious coincidence that at Bordeaux, in 1733,
the Academy received a memoir relative to the circulation
of the sap and coloured liquids in plants; and it was at
Bordeaux, a century afterwards, viz. 1837, that M. Boucherie
first mentioned his method.</p>

<p>M. Boucherie’s process was first discussed in Paris in
June, 1840. It consists in causing a solution of <i>sulphate
of copper</i> to penetrate to the interior of freshly cut woods,
to preserve them from decay; he occasionally used the
chloride of calcium, the <i>pyrolignite of iron</i> (<i>pyrolignite
brut de fer</i>), <i>prussiate of iron</i>, <i>prussiate of copper</i>, and
various other metallic salts. As a general rule sulphate
of copper is used; but when the hardness of the wood
is desired to be increased, pyrolignite of iron is taken
(1 gallon of iron to 6 gallons of water); and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
object is to render the wood flexible, elastic, and at the
same time uninflammable, chloride of calcium is used.
The liquid is taken up by the tree either whilst growing
in the earth or immediately after it has been felled. Not
more than two or three months should be allowed to
elapse before the timber is operated upon, but the sooner
it undergoes the process after being felled the better.</p>

<p>Sulphate of copper is said to be superior to corrosive
sublimate. Dr. Boucherie’s process of the injection of
wood with the salts of copper is as simple as it is easy.
For those woods intended for poles it consists in plunging
the base of a branch, furnished with leaves, into a tub
containing the solution. The liquid ascends into the
branches by the action of the leaves, and the wood is
impregnated with the preservative salt. As for logs, the
operation consists in cutting down the tree to be operated
upon; fixing at its base a plank, which is fixed by means
of a screw placed in the centre, and which can be
tightened at will when placed in the centre of the tree.
This plank has, on the side to be applied to the bottom of
the tree, a rather thick shield of leather, cloth, pasteboard,
or some other substance, intended to establish a space
between it and the wood, sufficient for the preserving
fluid to keep in contact with the freshly cut surface of
the tree. The liquid is brought there from a tub or
other reservoir, by the help of a slanting pole made
on the upper surface of the tree, and in which is put a
tube, adapted at its other extremity to a spigot in the
upper reservoir which contains the solution. A pressure
of 5 mètres suffices; so that the instant the sap of the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
is drawn away it escapes, and is replaced by the liquid
saturated with sulphate of copper. The proportion of
sulphate of copper in the solution should be 1 lb. of the
salt to 12½ gallons of water. As soon as the operation
terminates (and it lasts for some hours for the most
difficult logs), the wood is ready for use.</p>

<p>For various practical reasons, the first invention of
impregnating the wood of the tree whilst still in a
growing state, causing it to suck up various solutions by
means of the absorbing power of the leaves themselves,
was subsequently abandoned; and at the present time a
cheap, simple, and effective process is adopted for impregnating
the felled timbers with the preserving liquid,
designated in France “trait de scie, et la cuisse foulante.”
The trunk of a newly felled tree is cut into a length
suitable for two railway sleepers; a cross cut is made on
the prostrate timber to nearly nine-tenths of its diameter;
a wedge is then inserted, and a cord is wound round on
the cut surface, leaving a shallow chamber in the centre,
when it is then closed by withdrawing the wedge. A tube
is then inserted through an auger hole into this chamber,
and to this tube is attached an elastic connecting tube
from a reservoir placed some 20 or 30 feet above the level
on which the wood lies, and a stream of the saturating
fluid with this pressure passes into the chamber, presses
on the sap in the sap tubes, expels it at each end of the
tree, and itself supplies its place. The fluid used is a
solution of copper in water, in the proportion of 10 or
12 per cent., and a chemical test that ascertains the
pressure of the copper solution is applied at each end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the tree from which the sap exudes, by which the operator
ascertains when the process is completed.</p>

<p>A full account of this process may be found in the
number for June, 1840, of ‘Les Annales de Chimie et de
Physique.’ Messrs. de Mirbel, Arago, Poucelet, Andouin,
Gambey, Boussingault, and Dumas, on the part of l’Académie
des Sciences, made a report upon Dr. Boucherie’s
process, confirming the value of the invention. In France,
Dr. Boucherie, some years since, relinquished his brévet,
and threw the process open to the public, in consideration
of a national reward; whilst in England he has obtained
two patents (1838 and 1841), which, however, are similar
to Bethell’s patent, obtained by him on July 11, 1838:
<i>which is the same day and year of Boucherie’s patent</i>.
A prize medal was awarded for Dr. Boucherie’s process at
the Great Exhibition in London, in 1851, and a grande
médaille d’honneur, at the Paris Exhibition of 1855.
Many thousands of railway sleepers have been prepared
by this process, and laid down on the Great Northern
Railway of France, and are at present perfectly sound,
whilst others not prepared, on the same line, have rotted.
Boucherie’s process was used on Belgium railways up to
1859; and it is to be regretted that the reasons which led
to its abandonment have not been given in the reports of
the railway administration, as such reasons would have afforded
reliable data for future experimentalists to go upon.</p>

<p>Messrs. Légé and Fleury-Pironnet’s patent for the
injection of sulphate of copper into beech and poplar is
as follows: After the wood is placed, and the opening
hermetically sealed, a jet of steam is introduced, intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
at first to enter the timber and open its pores for the
purpose of obtaining a sudden vacuum, so as to establish
at any time a communication between the interior of the
cylinder and the cold water condenser; at the same time
the air pump is put in action. The vacuum caused is
very powerful, and is equal to 25½ ins. of the barometer.
Under the double influence of the heat and the vacuum
the sap is quickly evaporated from the wood as steam,
and ejected from the cylinder by the air pump, so that in
a very short time the wood is fully prepared to admit the
preserving liquid through the entire bulk.</p>

<p>The use of sulphate of copper for preserving timber
has not been, however, confined to France, for about the
time Dr. Boucherie brought forward his process, a Mr.
Margary took out a patent in England for the use of the
same material. His method consists in steeping the substances
to be preserved in a solution of sulphate of copper,
of the strength of 1 lb. of the sulphate to 8 gallons of
water, and leaving them in it till thoroughly saturated.
The timber is allowed to remain in the tank two days for
every inch of its thickness. Another method is to place
the timber in a closed iron vessel of great strength, and it
is made to imbibe the solution by exhaustion and pressure,
the operation occupying but a short time.</p>

<p>Sulphate of copper is sold in quantities at 4<i>d.</i> per lb.;
so that 100<i>l.</i> would buy 6000 lb., and each pound weight
is sufficient for 7 or 8 gallons of water, according to Margary;
or 12 gallons of water, according to Boucherie.</p>

<p>To preserve railway sleepers, the French railway engineers
require ¼ lb. of sulphate of copper per cubic foot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
say at least 12 lbs. to the load of 50 feet, to be used in a
2 per cent. solution; so that a load of timber can be rendered
imperishable for the sum of four shillings, exclusive
of labour, if sulphate of copper be reckoned at 4<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>

<p>With respect to the use of pyrolignite of iron, Mr.
Bethell considers it an expensive process, the pyrolignite
costing 6<i>d.</i> to 9<i>d.</i> per gallon, whilst the oil of tar can be
delivered at from 2<i>d.</i> to 3<i>d.</i> per gallon: the cost of these
materials is constantly varying.</p>

<p>A great many sleepers were prepared on the Great
Western Railway by pyrolignite of iron, and all have
<i>decayed</i>. Their black colour makes them exactly resemble
creosoted sleepers, and <i>many mistakes</i> have arisen from
this resemblance.</p>

<p>Messrs. Dorsett and Blythé’s (of Bordeaux) patent process
of preparing wood by the injection of heated solutions
of sulphate of copper is said to have been adopted by
French, Spanish, and Italian, as well as other continental
railway companies, by the French Government for their
navy and other constructions, and by telegraph companies
for poles on continental lines. It is as cheap as creosote,
and is employed in places where creosote cannot be had.
Wood prepared by it is rendered incombustible. Wood
for outdoor purposes so prepared has a clean yellowish
surface, without odour; it requires no painting, remains
unchangeable for any length of time, and can be employed
for any purpose, the same as unprepared material, and
carried with other cargo without hindrance.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Messrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Dorsett and Blythé’s process is similar to that of Mr.
Knab, which consisted of a solution of sulphate of copper,
heated to nearly boiling point, and placed in a lead
cylinder, protected by wood.</p>

<p>In 1846, 80,000 sleepers, treated with sulphate of
copper, were laid down on French railways, and after
nine years’ exposure were found to be as perfect as when
first laid.</p>

<p>Mr. H. W. Lewis, University of Michigan, U.S., thus
writes in the ‘Journal’ of the Franklin Institute, in 1866,
with reference to the decay of American railway sleepers:
“Allowing 2112 sleepers per mile, at 50 cents each,
1056 dols. per mile of American railroad decay every
seven years. Thoroughly impregnate those sleepers with
sulphate of copper, at a cost of 5 cents each, and they
would last twice as long. Thus would be effected a saving
of 880 dols. per mile in the seven years on sleepers alone.
In the United States, there are 33,906·6 miles of railroad.
The whole saving on these lines would be 29,389,568 dols.,
or upwards of 4,262,795 dols. per annum.”</p>

<p>With reference to the decay of unprepared wooden
sleepers, it may be here stated that the renewal of wooden
sleepers on the Calcutta and Delhi Indian line alone costs
annually 130,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The preservative action of sulphate of copper on wood
has long been known, but there are several things in its
action which require explanation. The ‘London Review’
says that Kœnig has lately investigated the chemical
reactions which occur when wood is impregnated with a
preservative solution of blue vitriol. He finds, as a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
rule, that a certain quantity of basic sulphate of copper
remains combined in the pores of the wood in such a
manner that it cannot be washed out with water. The
copper salt may be seen by its green colour in the spaces
between the yearly rings in the less compact portions of
the wood, that is to say, in those portions which contain
the sap. Those varieties of wood which contain the most
resin retain the largest amount of the copper salt&mdash;oak,
for example, retaining but little of it. The ligneous fibre
itself appears to have little or nothing to do with the
fluxation of the copper salt, and indeed none whatever is
retained in chemical combination, so that it cannot be
washed out with water, by pure cellulose. When wood,
from which all resin has been extracted by boiling alcohol,
is impregnated with sulphate of copper, it does not become
coloured like the original resinous wood, and the copper
salt contained in it may be readily washed out with water.
In like manner, from impregnated resinous wood all the
copper salt may be removed, with the resin, by means of
alcohol. The constituents of the blue vitriol are consequently
fixed in the wood by means of the resin which
this contains. Further, it is found that the impregnated
wood contains less nitrogen than that which is unimpregnated,
and that it is even possible to remove all the
nitrogenous components of the wood by long-continued
treatment with the solution of sulphate of copper; the
nitrogenous matters being soluble in an excess of this
solution, just as the precipitate which forms when aqueous
solutions of albumen and sulphate of copper are mixed is
soluble in excess of the latter. Since the nitrogenous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
matters are well known to be promoters of putrefaction,
their removal readily accounts for the increased durability
of the impregnated wood. The utility of blue vitriol as a
preservative may also depend on a measure upon the
resinous copper salt which is formed, by which the pores
of the wood are more or less filled up, and the ligneous
fibre covered, so that contact with the air is prevented,
and the attack of insects hindered. It is suggested that
those cases in which the anticipated benefits have not
been realized in practice, by impregnating wood with a
solution of blue vitriol, may probably be referred to the
use of an insufficient amount of this agent; that is, where
the wood was not immersed in the solution for a sufficient
length of time. The action should be one of lixiviation,
not merely of absorption.</p>

<p>In 1841, a German, named Müenzing, a chemist of
Heibronn, proposed <i>chloride of manganese</i> (waste liquor
in the manufacture of bleaching powder) as a preservative
against dry rot in timber; but his process has not been
adopted in England, and very little noticed abroad.</p>

<p>In July, 1841, Mr. Payne patented his invention for
<i>sulphate of iron</i> in London; and in June and November,
1846, in France; and in 1846 in London, for <i>carbonate of
soda</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The materials employed in Payne’s process are
sulphate of iron and sulphate of lime, both being held
in solution with water. The timber is placed in a cylinder
in which a vacuum is formed by the condensation of
steam, assisted by air pumps; a solution of sulphate of
iron is then admitted into the vessel, which instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
insinuates itself into all the pores of the wood, previously
freed from air by the vacuum, and, after about a minute’s
exposure, impregnates its entire substance; the <i>sulphate
of iron</i> is then withdrawn, and another solution of <i>sulphate
of lime</i> thrown in, which enters the substance of the wood
in the same manner as the former solution, and the two
salts react upon each other, and form two new combinations
within the substance of the wood&mdash;muriate of iron,
and muriate of lime. One of the most valuable properties
of timber thus prepared is its perfect incombustibility:
when exposed to the action of flame or strong heat, it
simply smoulders, and emits no flame. We may also
reasonably infer that with such a compound in its pores,
decay must be greatly retarded, and the liability to
worms lessened, if not prevented. The greatest drawback
consists in the increased difficulty of working.
This invention has been approved by the Commissioners
of Woods and Forests, and has received much approbation
from the architectural profession. Mr. Hawkshaw, C.E.,
considers that this process renders wood brittle. It was
employed for rendering wood uninflammable in the
Houses of Parliament (we presume, in the carcase; for
<i>steaming</i> was used for the joiner’s work), British Museum,
and other public buildings; and also for the Royal Stables
at Claremont.</p>

<p>In 1842, Mr. Bethell stated before the Institute of
Civil Engineers, London, that <i>silicate of potash</i>, or <i>soluble
glass</i>, rendered wood uninflammable.</p>

<p>In 1842, Professor Brande proposed <i>corrosive sublimate</i>
in <i>turpentine</i>, or <i>oil of tar</i>, as a preservative solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1845, Mr. Ransome suggested the application of
<i>silicate of soda</i>, to be afterwards decomposed by an acid
in the fibre of the wood; and in 1846, Mr Payne proposed
soluble sulphides of the earth (<i>barium sulphide</i>, &amp;c.),
to be also afterwards decomposed in the woods by
acids.</p>

<p>In 1855, a writer in the ‘Builder’ suggested an equal
mixture of alum and borax (biborate of soda) to be used
for making wood uninflammable. We have no objection
to the use of alum and borax to render wood uninflammable,
providing it does not <i>hurt the wood</i>.</p>

<p>Such are the <i>principal</i> patents, suggestions, and inventions,
up to the year 1856; but there are many more
which have been brought before the public, some of
which we will now describe.</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin, some years since, proposed absorption, first,
of <i>lime water</i>, then of a weak solution of <i>sulphuric acid</i>,
drying between the two, so as to form a gypsum (sulphate
of lime) in the pores of the wood, the latter to be previously
well seasoned, and when prepared to be used in a
dry situation.</p>

<p>Dr. Parry has recommended a preparation composed of
<i>bees-wax</i>, <i>roll brimstone</i>, and <i>oil</i>, in the proportion of 1,
2, and 3 ounces to ¾ gallon of water; to be boiled together
and laid on hot.</p>

<p>Mr. Pritchard, C.E., of Shoreham, succeeded in establishing
<i>pyrolignite of iron</i> and <i>oil of tar</i> as a preventive
of dry rot; the pyrolignite to be used very pure, the oil
applied afterwards, and to be perfectly free from any
particle of ammonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Toplis recommends the introduction into the pores
of the timber of a solution of sulphate or muriate of iron;
the solution may be in the proportion of about 2 lb. of
the salt to 4 or 5 gallons of water.</p>

<p>An invention has been lately patented by Mr. John
Cullen, of the North London Railway, Bow, for preserving
wood from decay. The inventor proposes to use a composition
of <i>coal-tar</i>, <i>lime</i>, and <i>charcoal</i>; the charcoal to
be reduced to a fine powder, and also the lime. These
materials to be well mixed, and subjected to heat, and the
wood immersed therein. The impregnation of the wood
with the composition may be materially aided by means
of exhaustion and pressure. Wood thus prepared is considered
to be proof against the attacks of the white ant.</p>

<p>The process of preserving wood from decay invented by
Mr. L. S. Robins, of New York, was proposed to be worked
extensively by the “British Patent Wood Preserving
Company.” It consists in first removing the surface
moisture, and then charging and saturating the wood with
hot <i>oleaginous vapours</i> and compounds. As the Robins’
process applies the preserving material in the form of
vapour, the wood is left clean, and after a few hours’
exposure to the air it is said to be fit to be handled for
any purposes in which elegant workmanship is required.
Neither science nor extraordinary skill is required in conducting
the process, and the treatment under the patent
is said to involve only a trifling expense.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the use of <i>petroleum</i>.
The almost unlimited supply of it within the last few years
has opened out a new and almost boundless source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
wealth. An invention has been patented in the name of
Mr. A. Prince, which purports to be an improvement in
the mode of preserving timber by the aid of petroleum.
The invention consists, firstly, in the immersion of the
timber in a suitable vessel or receptacle, and to exhaust
the air therefrom, by the ordinary means of preserving
wood by saturation. The crude petroleum is next conveyed
into the vessel, and thereby caused to penetrate
into every pore or interstice of the woody fibre, the effect
being, it is said, to thoroughly preserve the wood from
decay. He also proposes to mix any cheap mineral paint
or pigment with crude petroleum to be used as a coating
for the bottom of ships before the application of the sheathing,
and also to all timber for building or other purposes.
The composition is considered to render the timber indestructible,
and to repel the attacks of insects. Without
expressing any opinion upon this patent as applied to wood
for building purposes, we must again draw attention to
the high inflammability of petroleum.</p>

<p>The ‘Journal’ of the Board of Arts and Manufactures for
Upper Canada considers the following to be the cheapest
and the best mode of preserving timber in Canada: Let
the timbers be placed in a drying chamber for a few hours,
where they would be exposed to a temperature of about
200°, so as to drive out all moisture, and by heat, coagulate
the albuminous substance, which is so productive of
decay. Immediately upon being taken out of the drying
chamber, they should be thrown into a tank containing
crude petroleum. As the wood cools, the air in the pores
will contract, and the petroleum occupy the place it filled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Such is the extraordinary attraction shown by this substance
for dry surfaces, that by the process called capillary
attraction, it would gradually find its way into the interior
of the largest pieces of timber, and effectually coat the
walls and cells, and interstitial spaces. During the lapse
of time, the petroleum would absorb oxygen, and become
inspissated, and finally converted into a bituminous substance,
which would effectually shield the wood from destruction
by the ordinary processes of decay. The process
commends itself on account of its cheapness. A drying
chamber might easily be constructed of sheet iron properly
strengthened, and petroleum is very abundant and accessible.
Immediately after the pieces of timber have been
taken out of the petroleum vat, they should be sprinkled
with wood ashes in order that a coating of this substance
may adhere to the surface, and carbonate of potash be
absorbed to a small depth. The object of this is to render
the surface incombustible; and dusting with wood ashes
until quite dry will destroy this property to a certain extent.</p>

<p>The woodwork of farm buildings in this country is sometimes
subjected to the following: Take two parts of <i>gas-tar</i>,
one part of <i>pitch</i>, one part <i>half caustic lime</i> and <i>half common
resin</i>; mix and boil these well together, and put them
on the wood quite hot. Apply two or three coats, and
while the last coat is still warm, dash on it a quantity of
well-washed sharp sand, previously prepared by being
sifted through a sieve. The surface of the wood will then
have a complete stone appearance, and may be durable.
It is, of course, necessary, that the wood be perfectly dry,
and one coat should be well hardened before the next is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
put on. It is necessary, by the use of lime and long boiling,
to get quit of the ammonia of the tar, as it is considered
to injure the wood.</p>

<p>Mr. Abel, the eminent chemist to the War Department,
recommends the application of <i>silicate of soda</i> in solution,
for giving to wood, when applied to it like paint, a hard
coating, which is durable for several years, and is also a
considerable protection against fire. The silicate of soda,
which is prepared for use in the form of a thick syrup, is
diluted in water in the proportion of 1 part by measure
of the syrup to 4 parts of water, which is added slowly,
until a perfect mixture is obtained by constant stirring.
The wood is then washed over <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> times with this
liquid by means of an ordinary whitewash brush, so as to
absorb as much of it as possible. When this first coating
is nearly dry, the wood is painted over with <i>another</i> wash
made by slaking good fat lime, diluted to the consistency
of thick cream. Then, after the limewash has become
moderately dry, <i>another</i> solution of the silicate of soda, in
the proportion of 1 of soda to 2 of water, is applied in the
same manner as the first coating. The preparation of
the wood is then complete; but if the lime coating has
been applied too quickly, the surface of the wood may be
found, when quite dry, after the last coating of the
silicate, to give off a little lime when rubbed with the
hand; in which case it should be <i>once more</i> coated over
with a solution of the silicate of the same strength as in
the first operation. If Mr. Abel had been an architect
or builder, he would never have invented this process.
What would the cost be? and would not a special clerk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the works be necessary to carry out this method in
practice?</p>

<p>The following coating for piles and posts, to prevent
them from rotting, has been recommended on account of
its being economical, impermeable to water, and nearly as
hard as stone: Take 50 parts of <i>resin</i>, 40 of <i>finely powdered
chalk</i>, 300 parts of <i>fine white sharp sand</i>, 4 parts of
<i>linseed oil</i>, 1 part of native <i>red oxide of copper</i>, and 1 part
of <i>sulphuric acid</i>. First, heat the resin, chalk, sand, and
oil, in an iron boiler; then add the oxide, and, with care,
the acid; stir the composition carefully, and apply the
coat while it is still hot. If it be not liquid enough, add a
little more oil. This coating, when it is cold and dry,
forms a varnish which is as hard as stone.</p>

<p>Another method for fencing, gate-posts, garden stakes,
and timber which is to be buried in the earth, may be mentioned.
Take 11 lb. of <i>blue vitriol</i> (sulphate of copper)
and 20 quarts of water; dissolve the vitriol with boiling
water, and then add the remainder of the water. The
end of the wood is then to be put into the solution, and
left to stand four or five days; for shingle, three days
will answer, and for posts, 6 inches square, ten days,
Care should be taken that the saturation takes place in
a well-pitched tank or keyed box, for the reason that
any barrel will be shrunk by the operation so as to leak.
Instead of expanding an old cask, as other liquids do, this
shrinks it. This solution has also been used in dry rot
cases, when the wood is only slightly affected.</p>

<p>It will sometimes be found that when oak fencing is
put up new, and tarred or painted, a fungus will vegetate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
through the dressing, and the interior of the wood
be rapidly destroyed; but when undressed it seems
that the weather desiccates the gum or sap, and leaves
only the woody fibre, and the fence lasts for many
years.</p>

<p>About fifteen years ago, Professor Crace Calvert, F.R.S.,
made an investigation for the Admiralty, of the qualities
of different woods used in ship-building. He found the
goodness of teak to consist in the fact that it is highly
charged with <i>caoutchouc</i>; and he considered that if the
tannin be soaked out of a block of oak, it may then be
interpenetrated by a <i>solution of caoutchouc</i>, and thereby
rendered as lasting as teak.</p>

<p>We can only spare the space for a few words about this
method.</p>

<p>1st. We have seen lead which has formed part of the
gutter of a building previous to its being burnt down:
lead melts at 612° F.; caoutchouc at 248° F.; therefore
caoutchouc would not prevent wood from being destroyed
by fire. At 248° caoutchouc is highly inflammable, burns
with a white flame and much smoke.</p>

<p>2nd. We are informed by a surgical bandage-maker of
high repute, that caoutchouc, when used in elastic kneecaps,
&amp;c., <i>will perish</i>, if the articles are left in a drawer
for two or three years. When hard, caoutchouc is brittle.</p>

<p>Would it be advisable to interpenetrate oak with a
solution of caoutchouc? In 1825, Mr. Hancock proposed
a solution of 1½ lb. of caoutchouc in 3 lb. of essential
oil, to which was to be added 9 lb. of tar. Mr. Parkes,
in 1843, and M. Passez, in 1845, proposed to dissolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
caoutchouc in sulphur: painting or immersing the wood.
Maconochie, in 1805, after his return from India, proposed
distilled <i>teak</i> chips to be injected into fir woods.</p>

<p>Although England has been active in endeavouring to
discover the best and cheapest remedy for dry rot, France
has also been active in the same direction.</p>

<p>M. le Comte de Chassloup Lambat, Member of the late
Imperial Senate of France, considers that, as <i>sulphur</i> is
most prejudicial to all species of fungi, there might,
perhaps, be some means of making it serviceable in the
preservation of timber. We know with what success it is
used in medicine. It is also known that coopers burn a
sulphur match in old casks before using them&mdash;a practice
which has evidently for its object the prevention of mustiness,
often microscopic, which would impart a bad flavour
to the wine.</p>

<p>M. de Lapparent, late Inspector-General of Timber for
the French Navy, proposed to prevent the growth of fungi
by the use of a paint having flour of sulphur as a basis,
and linseed oil as an amalgamater. In 1862 he proposed
charring wood; we have referred to this process in our
last chapter (p. 96).</p>

<p>The paint was to be composed of:</p>

<table summary="Composition of paint">
  <tr>
    <td>Flour of sulphur</td>
    <td class="tdr">200</td>
    <td>grammes</td>
    <td class="tdr">3,088</td>
    <td>grains.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Common linseed oil</td>
    <td class="tdr">135</td>
    <td class="center">”</td>
    <td class="tdr">2,084</td>
    <td class="center">”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prepared oil of manganese</td>
    <td class="tdr">30</td>
    <td class="center">”</td>
    <td class="tdr">463</td>
    <td class="center">”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>He considered that by smearing here and there either
the surfaces of the ribs of a ship, or below the ceiling,
with this paint, a slightly sulphurous atmosphere will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
be developed in the hold, which will purify the air by
destroying, at least in part, the sporules of the fungi. He
has since stated that his anticipations have been fully
realized. M. de Lapparent also proposes to prevent the
decay of timber by subjecting it to a skilful carbonization
with common inflammable coal gas. An experiment was
made at Cherbourg, which was stated to be completely
successful. The cost is only about 10 cents per square
yard of framing and planking.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> M. de Lapparent’s gas
method is useful for burning off old paint. We saw it in
practice (April, 1875) at Waterloo Railway Station, London,
and it appeared to be effective.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of MM. Le Châtelier (Engineer-in-chief
of mines) and Flachat, C.E.’s, M. Ranee, a few years
since, injected in a Légé and Fleury cylinder certain
pieces of white fir, red fir, and pitch pine with <i>chloride
of sodium</i>, which had been deprived of the manganesian
salts it contained, to destroy its deliquescent property.
Some pieces were injected four times, but the greatest
amount of solution injected into pitch pine heart-wood
was from 3 to 4 per cent., and very little more was
injected into the white and red fir heart-wood. It was
also noticed that sapwood, after being injected four times,
only gained 8 per cent. in weight in the last three operations.
The experiments made to test the relative incombustibility
of the injected wood showed that the process
was a complete failure; the prepared wood burning as
quickly as the unprepared wood.</p>

<p>M. Paschal le Gros, of Paris, has patented his system for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
preserving all kinds of wood, by means of a <i>double salt of
manganese</i> and of <i>zinc</i>, used either alone or with an admixture
of <i>creosote</i>. The solution, obtained in either of the two
ways, is poured into a trough, and the immersion of the logs
or pieces of wood is effected by placing them vertically in
the trough in such a manner that they are steeped in the
liquid to about three-quarters of their length. The wood
is thus subjected to the action of the solution during a
length of time varying from twelve to forty-eight hours.
The solution rises in the fibres of the wood, and impregnates
them by the capillary force alone, without requiring
any mechanical action. The timber is said to become
incombustible, hard, and very lasting.</p>

<p>M. Fontenay, C.E., in 1832, proposed to act upon the
wood with what he designated <i>metallic soap</i>, which could
be obtained from the residue in greasing boxes of carriages;
also from the acid remains of <i>oil</i>, <i>suet</i>, <i>iron</i>, and
<i>brass dust</i>; all being melted together. In 1816 Chapman
tried experiments with <i>yellow soap</i>; but to render it sufficiently
fluid it required forty times its weight of water,
in which the quantity of resinous matter and tallow
would scarcely exceed ⅟80th; therefore no greater portion
of these substances could be left in the pores of the wood,
which could produce little effect.</p>

<p>M. Letellier, in 1837, proposed to use <i>deuto-chloride of
mercury</i> as a preservative for wood.</p>

<p>M. Dondeine’s process was formerly used in France and
Germany. It is a paint, consisting of many ingredients,
the principal being <i>linseed oil, resin, white lead, vermilion,
lard, and oxide of iron</i>. All these are to be well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
mixed, and reduced by boiling to one-tenth, and then
applied with a brush. If applied cold, a little varnish or
turpentine to be added.</p>

<p>Little is known in England of the inventions which
have arisen in foreign countries not already mentioned.</p>

<p>M. Szerelmey, a Hungarian, proposed, in 1868, <i>potassa</i>,
<i>lime</i>, <i>sulphuric acid</i>, <i>petroleum</i>, &amp;c., to preserve wood.</p>

<p>In Germany, the following method is sometimes used for
the preservation of wood: Mix 40 parts of <i>chalk</i>, 40 parts
of <i>resin</i>, 4 of <i>linseed oil</i>; melting them together in an iron
pot; then add 1 part of native <i>oxide of copper</i>, and afterwards,
carefully, 1 part of <i>sulphuric acid</i>. The mixture is
applied while hot to the wood by means of a brush, and it
soon becomes very hard.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Cobley, of Meerholz, Hesse, has patented the following
preparation. A strong solution of <i>potash</i>, <i>baryta</i>,
<i>lime</i>, <i>strontia</i>, or any of their salts, are forced into the
pores of timber in a close iron vessel by a pump. After
this operation, the liquid is run off from the timber, and
<i>hydro-fluo-silicic acid</i> is forced in, which, uniting with the
salts in the timber, forms an insoluble compound capable
of rendering the wood uninflammable.</p>

<p>About the year 1800, Neils Nystrom, chemist, Norkopping,
recommended a solution of <i>sea salt and copperas</i>,
to be laid upon timber as hot as possible, to prevent
rottenness or combustion. He also proposed a solution of
<i>sulphate of iron</i>, <i>potash</i>, <i>alum</i>, &amp;c., to extinguish fires.</p>

<p>M. Louis Vernet, Buenos Ayres, proposed to preserve
timber from fire by the use of the following mixture: Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
1 lb. of <i>arsenic</i>, 6 lb. of <i>alum</i>, and 10 lb. of <i>potash</i>, in 40
gallons of water, and mix with <i>oil</i>, or any suitable tarry
matters, and paint the timber with the solution. We
have already referred to the conflicting evidence respecting
alum and water for wood: we can now state that
Chapman’s experiments proved that <i>arsenic</i> afforded no
protection against dry rot. Experiments in Cornwall
have proved that where arsenical ores have lain on the
ground, vegetation will ensue in two or three years after
removal of the ore. If, therefore, alum or arsenic have
no good effect on timber with respect to the dry rot, we
think the use of both of them together would certainly be
objectionable.</p>

<p>The last we intend referring to is a composition frequently
used in China, for preserving wood. Many
buildings in the capital are painted with it. It is called
<i>Schoicao</i>, and is made with 3 parts of blood deprived of
its febrine, 4 parts of lime and a little alum, and 2 parts
of liquid silicate of soda. It is sometimes used in Japan.</p>

<p>It would be practically useless to quote any further
remedies, and the reader is recommended to carefully
study those quoted in this chapter, and of their utility
to judge for himself, bearing in mind those principles
which we have referred to before commencing to describe
the patent processes. A large number of patents have
been taken out in England for the preservation of wood
by preservative processes, but only two are now in use,&mdash;that
is, to any extent,&mdash;viz. Bethell’s and Burnett’s. Messrs.
Bethell and Co. now impregnate timber with <i>copper, zinc,
corrosive sublimate, or creosote</i>; the four best patents.</p>

<p>For the <i>non-professional</i> reader we find we have <i>three</i>
facts:</p>

<p>1st. The most successful patentees have been Bethell
and Burnett, in England; and Boucherie, in France:
all B’s.</p>

<p>2nd. The most successful patents have been <i>knighted</i>.
Payne’s patent was, we believe, used by Sirs R. Smirke
and C. Barry; Kyan’s, by Sir R. Smirke; Burnett’s, by
Sirs M. Peto, P. Roney, and H. Dryden; while Bethell’s
patent can claim Sir I. Brunel, and many other knights.
We believe Dr. Boucherie received the Legion of Honour
in France.</p>

<p>3rd. There are only at the present time three timber-preserving
works in London, and they are owned by
Messrs. Bethell and Co., Sir F. Burnett and Co., and
Messrs. Burt, Boulton, and Co.: all names commencing
with the letter B.</p>

<p>For the <i>professional</i> reader we find we have <i>three hard</i>
facts:</p>

<p>The most successful patents may be placed in three
classes, and we give the key-note of their success.</p>

<p>1st. <span class="smcap">One material and one application.</span>&mdash;Creosote,
Petroleum. <i>Order</i>&mdash;Ancient Egyptians, or Bethell’s,
Burmese.</p>

<p>2nd. <span class="smcap">Two materials and one application.</span>&mdash;Chloride
of zinc and water; sulphate of copper and water; corrosive
sublimate and water. <i>Order</i>&mdash;Burnett, Boucherie,
Kyan.</p>

<p>3rd. <span class="smcap">Two materials and two applications.</span>&mdash;Sulphate
of iron and water; afterwards sulphate of lime and
water. Payne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>We thus observe there are <i>twice three</i> successful patent
processes.</p>

<p>Any inventions which cannot be brought under these
three classes have had a short life; at least, we think so.</p>

<p>The same remarks will apply to <i>external</i> applications
for wood&mdash;for instance, coal-tar, <i>one application</i>, is more
used for fencing than any other material.</p>

<p>We are much in want of a valuable series of experiments
on the application of various chemicals on wood to
resist <i>burning to pieces</i>; without causing it to <i>rot speedily</i>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE MEANS OF PREVENTING DRY ROT IN MODERN
HOUSES; AND THE CAUSES OF THEIR DECAY.</span></h2>

<p>Although writers on dry rot have generally deemed it a
new disease, there is foundation to believe that it pervaded
the British Navy in the reign of Charles II. “Dry rot
received a little attention” so writes Sir John Barrow,
“about the middle of the last century, at some period of
Sir John Pringle’s presidency of the Royal Society of
London.” As timber trees were, no doubt, subject to
the same laws and conditions 500 years ago as they are
at the present day, it is indeed extremely probable that
if at that time unseasoned timber was used, and subjected
to heat and moisture, dry rot made its appearance. We
propose in this chapter to direct attention to the several
causes of the decay of wood, which by proper building
might be averted.</p>

<p>The necessity of proper ventilation round the timbers of
a building has been repeatedly advised in this volume;
for even timber which has been naturally seasoned is at
all times disposed to resume, from a warm and stagnant
atmosphere, the elements of decay. We cannot therefore
agree with the following passage from Captain E. M.
Shaw’s book on ‘Fire Surveys,’ which is to be found at
page 44:&mdash;“Circulation of air should on no account be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
permitted in any part of a building not exposed to view,
especially under floors, or inside skirting boards, or
wainscots.” In the course of this chapter, the evil results
from a want of a proper circulation of air will be shown.</p>

<p>In warm cellars, or any close confined situations, where
the air is filled with vapour without a current to change
it, dry rot proceeds with astonishing rapidity, and the
timber work is destroyed in a very short time. The
bread rooms of ships; behind the skirtings, and under
the wooden floors, or the basement stories of houses,
particularly in kitchens, or other rooms where there are
constant fires; and, in general, in every place where wood
is exposed to warmth and damp air, the dry rot will soon
make its appearance.</p>

<p>All kinds of stoves are sure to increase the disease if
moisture be present. The effect of heat is also evident
from the rapid decay of ships in hot climates; and the
warm moisture given out by particular cargoes is also
very destructive. Hemp will, without being injuriously
heated, emit a moist warm vapour: so will pepper (which
will affect teak) and cotton. The ship ‘Brothers’ built at
Whitby, of green timber, proceeded to St. Petersburgh
for a cargo of hemp. The next year it was found on
examination that her timbers were rotten, and all the
planking, except a thin external skin. It is also an
important fact that rats very rarely make their appearance
in dry places: under floors they are sometimes very
destructive.</p>

<p>As rats will sometimes destroy the structural parts of
wood framing, a few words about them may not be out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
place. If poisoned wheat, arsenic, &amp;c., be used, the
creatures will simply eat the things and die under the
floor, causing an intolerable stench. The best method is
to make a small hole in a corner of the floor (unless they
make it themselves) large enough to permit them to come
up; the following course is then recommended:&mdash;Take
oil of amber and ox-gall in equal parts; add to them oatmeal
or flour sufficient to form a paste, which divide into
little balls, and lay them in the middle of the infested
apartment <i>at night</i> time. Surround the balls with a
number of saucers filled with water&mdash;the smell of the oil
is sure to attract the rats, they will greedily devour the
balls, and becoming intolerably thirsty will drink till they
die on the spot. They can be buried in the morning.</p>

<p>Building timber into new walls is often a cause of
decay, as the lime and damp brickwork are active agents
in producing putrefaction, particularly where the scrapings
of roads are used, instead of sand, for mortar. Hence it is
that bond timbers, wall plates, and the ends of girders,
joists, and lintels are so frequently found in a state of
decay. The ends of brestsummers are sometimes cased in
sheet lead, zinc, or fire-brick, as being impervious to
moisture. The old builders used to bed the ends of
girders and joists in loam instead of mortar, as directed
in the Act of Parliament, 19 Car. II. c. 3, for rebuilding
the City of London.</p>

<p>In Norway, all posts in contact with the earth are carefully
wrapped round with flakes of birch bark for a few
inches above and below the ground.</p>

<p>Timber that is to lie in mortar&mdash;as, for instance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
ends of joists, door sills and frames of doors and windows,
and the ends of girders&mdash;if pargeted over with hot pitch,
will, it is said, be preserved from the effects of the lime.
In taking down, some years since, in France, some portion
of the ancient Château of the Roque d’Oudres, it was
found that the extremities of the oak girders were perfectly
preserved, although these timbers were supposed to
have been in their places for upwards of 600 years. The
whole of these extremities buried in the walls were completely
wrapped round with plates of cork. When demolishing
an ancient Benedictine church at Bayonne, it
was found that the whole of the fir girders were entirely
worm eaten and rotten, with the exception, however, of
the bearings, which, as in the case just mentioned, were
also completely wrapped round with plates of cork. These
facts deserve consideration.</p>

<p>If any of our professional readers should wish to try
cork for the ends of girders, they will do well to choose
the Spanish cork, which is the best.</p>

<p>In this place it may not be amiss to point out the
dangerous consequences of building walls so that their
principal support depends on timber. The usual method
of putting bond timber into walls is to lay it next the
inside; this bond often decays, and, of course, leaves the
walls resting only upon the external course or courses of
brick; and fractures, bulges, or absolute failures are the
natural consequences. This evil is in some degree avoided
by placing the bond in the middle of the wall, so that
there is brickwork on each side, and by not putting continued
bond for nailing the battens to. We object to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
placing bond in the middle of a wall: the best way,
where it can be managed, is to corbel out the wall, resting
the ends of the joists on the top course of bricks; thus
doing away with the wood-plate. In London, wood bond is
prohibited by Act of Parliament, and hoop-iron bond (well
tarred and sanded) is now generally used. The following
is an instance of the bad effects of placing wood bond in
walls: In taking down portions of the audience part and
the whole of the corridors of the original main walls of
Covent Garden Theatre, London, in 1847, which had only
been built about thirty-five years, the wood horizontal
bond timbers, although externally appearing in good condition,
were found, on a close examination by Mr. Albano,
much affected by shrinkage, and the majority of them
quite rotten in the centre, consequently the whole of them
were ordered to be taken out in short lengths, and the
space to be filled in with brickwork and cement.</p>

<p>Some years since we had a great deal to do with “Fire
Surveys;” that is to say, surveying buildings to estimate
the cost of reinstating them after being destroyed by fire;
and we often noticed that the wood bond, being rotten,
was seriously charred by the fire, and had to be cut out
in short lengths, and brickwork in cement “pinned in”
in its place. Brestsummers and story posts are rarely
sufficiently burnt to affect the stability of the front wall
of a shop building.</p>

<p>In bad foundations, it used to be common, before concrete
came into vogue, to lie planks to build upon. Unless
these planks were absolutely wet, they were certain to rot
in such situations, and the walls settled; and most likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
irregularly, rending the building to pieces. Instances of
such kind of failure frequently occur. It was found necessary,
a few years since, to underpin three of the large
houses in Grosvenor Place, London, at an immense expense.
In one of these houses the floors were not less
than three inches out of level, the planking had been
seven inches thick, and most of it was completely rotten:
it was of yellow fir. A like accident happened to Norfolk
House, St. James’s Square, London, where oak planking
had been used.</p>

<p>As an example of the danger of trusting to timber in
supporting heavy stone or brickwork, the failure of the
curb of the brick dome of the church of St. Mark, at
Venice, may be cited. This dome was built upon a curb
of larch timber, put together in thicknesses, with the joints
crossed, and was intended to resist the tendency which a
dome has to spread outwards at the base. In 1729, a
large crack and several smaller ones were observed in the
dome. On examination, the wooden curb was found to be
in a completely rotten state, and it was necessary to raise
a scaffold from the bottom to secure the dome from ruin.
After it was secured from falling, the wooden curb was
removed, and a course of stone, with a strong band of iron,
was put in its place.</p>

<p>It is said that another and very important source of
destruction is the applying end to end of two different
kinds of wood: oak to fir, oak to teak or lignum vitæ; the
harder of the two will decay at the point of juncture.</p>

<p>The bad effects resulting from damp walls are still
further increased by hasty finishing. To enclose with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
plastering and joiners’ work the walls and timbers of a
building while they are in a damp state is the most
certain means of causing the building to fall into a
premature state of decay.</p>

<p>Mr. George Baker, builder of the National Gallery,
London, remarked, in 1835, “I have seen the dry rot all
over Baltic timber in three years, in consequence of
putting it in contact with moist brickwork; the rot was
caused by the badness of the mortar, it was so long
drying.”</p>

<p>Slating the external surface of a wall, to keep out the
rain or damp, is sometimes adopted: a high wall (nearly
facing the south-west) of a house near the north-west
corner of Blackfriars Bridge, London, has been recently
slated from top to bottom, to keep out damp.</p>

<p>However well timber may be seasoned, if it be employed
in a damp situation, decay is the certain consequence;
therefore it is most desirable that the neighbourhood of
buildings should be well drained, which would not only
prevent rot, but also increase materially the comfort of
those who reside in them. The drains should be made
water-tight wherever they come near to the walls; as
walls, particularly brick walls, draw up moisture to a very
considerable height: very strict supervision should be
placed over workmen while the drains of a building are
being laid. Earth should never be suffered to rest
against walls, and the sunk stories of buildings should
always be surrounded by an open area, so that the walls
may not absorb moisture from the earth: even open
areas require to be properly built. We will quote a case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to explain our meaning. A house was erected about
eighteen months ago, in the south-east part of London,
on sloping ground. Excavations were made for the basement
floor, and a dry area, “brick thick, in cement,”
was built at the back and side of the house, the top of
the area wall being covered with a stone coping; we do
not know whether the bottom of the area was drained.
On the top of the coping was placed mould, forming one
of the garden beds for flowers. Where the mould rested
against the walls, damp entered. The area walls should
have been built, in the first instance, above the level of
the garden-ground&mdash;which has since been done&mdash;otherwise,
in course of time, the ends of the next floor joists
would have become attacked by dry rot.</p>

<p>Some people imagine that if damp is in a wall the best
way to get rid of it is to seal it in, by plastering the
inside and stuccoing the outside of the wall; this is a great
mistake; damp will rise higher and higher, until it finds
an outlet; rotting in the meanwhile the wood bond and
ends of all the joists. We were asked recently to
advise in a curious case of this kind at a house in Croydon.
On wet days the wall (<i>stucco</i>, outside; <i>plaster</i>,
inside) was perfectly wet: bands of soft red bricks in
wall, at intervals, were the culprits. To prevent moisture
rising from the foundations, some substance that will not
allow it to pass should be used at a course or two above
the footings of the walls, but it should be below the level
of the lowest joists. “Taylor’s damp course” bricks are
good, providing the air-passages in them are kept free for
air to pass through: they are allowed sometimes to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
choked up with dirt. Sheets of lead or copper have been
used for that purpose, but they are very expensive.
Asphalted felt is quite as good; no damp can pass
through it. Care must, however, be taken in using it if
only one wall, say a party wall, has to be built. To lay two
or three courses of slates, bedded in cement, is a good
method, providing the slates “break joint,” and are well
bedded in the cement. Workmen require watching while
this is being done, because if any opening be left for damp
to rise, it will undoubtedly do so. A better method is to
build brickwork a few courses in height with Portland
cement instead of common mortar, and upon the upper
course to lay a bed of cement of about one inch in thickness;
or a layer of asphalte (providing the walls are all
carried up to the same level before the asphalte is applied
hot). As moisture does not penetrate these substances,
they are excellent materials for keeping out wet; and it
can easily be seen if the mineral asphalte has been properly
applied. To keep out the damp from basement
floors, lay down cement concrete 6 inches thick, and on
the top, asphalte 1 inch thick, and then lay the sleepers
and joists above; or bed the floor boards on the asphalte.</p>

<p>The walls and principal timbers of a building should
always be left for some time to dry after it is covered in.
This drying is of the greatest benefit to the work, particularly
the drying of the walls; and it also allows time for
the timbers to get settled to their proper bearings, which
prevents after-settlements and cracks in the finished
plastering. It is sometimes said that it is useful because
it allows the timber more time to season; but when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
carpenter considers that it is from the ends of the timber
that much of its moisture evaporates, he will see the impropriety
of leaving it to season after it is framed, and
also the cause of framed timbers of unseasoned wood failing
at the joints sooner than in any other place. No parts
of timber require the perfect extraction of the sap so
much as those that are to be joined.</p>

<p>When the plastering is finished, a considerable time
should be allowed for the work to get dry again before
the skirtings, the floors, and other joiners’ work be fixed.
Drying will be much accelerated by a free admission of
air, particularly in favourable weather. When a building
is thoroughly dried at first, openings for the admission of
fresh air are not necessary <i>when the precautions against
any new accessions of moisture have been effectual</i>. Indeed,
such openings only afford harbour for vermin: unfortunately,
however, buildings are so rarely dried when first
built, that air-bricks, &amp;c., in the floors are very necessary,
and if the timbers were so dried as to be free from water
(which could be done by an artificial process), the wood
would only be fit for joinery purposes. Few of our
readers would imagine that water forms ⅕th part of wood.

<p>Many houses at our seaport towns are erected with
mortar, having sea-sand in its composition, and then dry
rot makes its appearance. If no other sand can be
obtained, the best way is to have it washed at least <i>three
times</i> (the contractor being under strict supervision, and
subject to heavy penalties for evasion). After each
washing it should be left exposed to the action of the
sun, wind, and rain: the sand should also be frequently
turned over, so that the whole of it may in turn be
exposed; even then it tastes saltish, after the third operation.
A friend of ours has a house at Worthing, which
was erected a few years since with sea-sand mortar, and
on a wet day there is always a dampness hanging about
the house&mdash;every third year the staircase walls have to
be repapered: it “bags” from the walls.</p>

<p>In floors next the ground we cannot easily prevent the
access of damp, but this should be guarded against as far
as possible. All mould should be carefully removed, and,
if the situation admits of it, a considerable thickness of
dry materials, such as brickbats, dry ashes, broken glass,
clean pebbles, concrete, or the refuse of vitriol-works; but
no lime (unless unslaked) should be laid under the floor,
and over these a coat of smiths’ ashes, or of pyrites, where
they can be procured. The timber for the joists should
be well seasoned; and it is advisable to cut off all connection
between wooden ground floors and the rest of the
woodwork of the building. A flue carried up in the wall
next the kitchen chimney, commencing under the floor,
and terminating at the top of the wall, and covered to prevent
the rain entering, would take away the damp under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a kitchen floor. In Hamburg it is a common practice to
apply mineral asphalte to the basement floors of houses
to prevent capillary attraction; and in the towns of the
north of France, gas-tar has become of very general use
to protect the basement of the houses from the effects
of the external damp.</p>

<p>Many houses in the suburbs (particularly <span class="smcap">Stucconia</span>) of
London are erected by speculating builders. As soon as
the carcase of a house is finished (perhaps before) the
builder is unable to proceed, for want of money, and the
carcase is allowed to stand unfinished for months. Showers
of rain saturate the previously unseasoned timbers, and
pools of water collect on the basement ground, into which
they gradually, but surely, soak. Eventually the houses
are finished (probably by half a dozen different tradesmen,
employed by a mortgagee); bits of wood, rotten sawdust,
shavings, &amp;c., being left under the basement floor. The
house when finished, having pretty (!) paper on the walls,
plate-glass in the window-sashes, and a bran new brick
and stucco portico to the front door, is quickly let. Dry
rot soon appears, accompanied with its companions, the
many-coloured fungi; and when their presence should
be known from their smell, the anxious wife probably
exclaims to her husband, “My dear! there is a very
strange smell which appears to come from the children’s
playroom: had you not better send for Mr. Wideawake,
the builder, for I am sure there is <i>something the matter
with the drains</i>.” Defective ventilation, dry rot, <i>green</i>
water thrown down sinks, &amp;c., do not cause smells, it’s
<i>the drains</i>, of course!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>There is another cause which affects all wood most
materially, which is the application of paint, tar, or pitch
before the wood has been thoroughly dried. The nature
of these bodies prevents all evaporation; and the result of
this is that the centre of the wood is transformed into
touchwood. On the other hand, the doors, pews, and
carved work of many old churches have never been
painted, and yet they are often found to be perfectly
sound, after having existed more than a century. In
Chester, Exeter, and other old cities, where much timber
was formerly used, even for the external parts of buildings,
it appears to be sound and perfect, though black
with age, and has never been painted.</p>

<p>Mr. Semple, in his treatise on ‘Building in Water,’
mentions an instance of some field-gates made of home fir,
part of which, being near the mansion, were painted; while
the rest, being in distant parts of the grounds, were not
painted. Those which were painted soon became quite
rotten, but the others, which were not painted, continued
sound.</p>

<p>Another cause of dry rot, which is sometimes found in
suburban and country houses, is the presence of large
trees near the house. We are acquainted with the
following remarkable instance:&mdash;At the northern end of
Kilburn, London, stands Stanmore Cottage, erected a
great many years ago: about fifty feet in front of it is an
old elm-tree. The owner, a few years since, noticed
cracks round the portico of the house; these cracks
gradually increased in size, and other cracks appeared
in the window arches, and in different parts of the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and internal walls. The owner became alarmed,
and sent for an experienced builder, who advised underpinning
the walls. Workmen immediately commenced to
remove the ground from the foundations, and it was then
found that the foundations, as well as the joists, were
honeycombed by the roots of the elm-tree, which were
growing alongside the joists, the whole being surrounded
by large masses of white and yellow dry-rot fungus.</p>

<p>The insufficient use of tarpaulins is another frequent
cause of dry rot. A London architect had (a few years
since) to superintend the erection of a church in the
south-west part of London; an experienced builder was
employed. The materials were of the best description
and quality. When the walls were sufficiently advanced
to receive the roof, rain set in; as the clown in one of
Shakespeare’s plays observed, “the rain, it raineth every
day;” it was so, we are told, in this case for some days.
The roof when finished was ceiled below with a plaster
ceiling; and above (not with “dry oakum without pitch”
but) with slates. A few months afterwards some of the
slates had to be reinstated, in consequence of a heavy
storm, and it was then discovered that nearly all the
timbers of the roof were affected by dry rot. This was
an air-tight roof.</p>

<p>In situations favourable to rot, painting prevents every
degree of exhalation, depriving at the same time the wood
of the influence of the air, and the moisture runs through
it, and insidiously destroys the wood. Most surveyors
know that moist oak cills to window frames will soon rot,
and the painting is frequently renewed; a few taps with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
two-feet brass rule joint on the top and front of cill will soon
prove their condition. Wood should be a year or more
before it is painted; or, better still, never painted at
all. Artificers can tell by the sound of any substance
whether it be healthy or decayed as accurately as a
musician can distinguish his notes: thus, a bricklayer
strikes the wall with his crow, and a carpenter a piece of
timber with his hammer. The Austrians used formerly
to try the goodness of the timber for ship-building by the
following method: One person applies his ear to the
centre of one end of the timber, while another, with a key,
hits the other end with a gentle stroke. If the wood be
sound and good, the stroke will be distinctly heard at the
other end, though the timber should be fifty feet or more
in length. Timber affected with rot yields a particular
sound when struck, but if it were painted, and the distemper
had made much progress, with no severe stroke
the outside breaks like a shell. The auger is a very useful
instrument for testing wood; the wood or sawdust
it brings out can be judged by its smell; which
may be the fresh smell of pure wood: the vinous smell,
or first degree of fermentation, which is alcoholic; or the
second degree, which is putrid. The sawdust may also be
tested by rubbing it between the fingers.</p>

<p>According to Colonel Berrien, the Michigan Central
Railroad Bridge, at Niles, was painted <i>before seasoning</i>,
with “Ohio fire-proof paint,” forming a glazed surface.
After five years it was so rotten as to require rebuilding.</p>

<p>Painted floor-cloths are very injurious to wooden floors,
and frequently produce rottenness in the floors that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
covered with them, as the painted cloth prevents the
access of air, and retains whatever dampness the boards may
absorb, and therefore soon causes decay. Carpets are not
so injurious, but still assist in retarding free evaporation.</p>

<p>Captain E. M. Shaw, in ‘Fire Surveys,’ thus writes of
the floors of a building, “They might with advantage be
caulked like a ship’s deck, only with dry oakum, without
pitch.” Let us see how far oil floor-cloth and kamptulicon
will assist us in obtaining an air-tight floor.</p>

<p>In London houses there is generally <i>one</i> room on the
basement floor which is carefully covered over with an
oiled floor-cloth. In such a room the dry rot often makes
its appearance. The wood absorbs the aqueous vapour
which the oil-cloth will not allow to escape; and being
assisted by the heat of the air in such apartments, the
decay goes on rapidly. Sometimes, however, the dry rot
is only confined to the top of the floor. At No. 106, Fenchurch
Street, London, a wood floor was washed (a few
years since) for a tenant, and oil-cloth was laid down.
Circumstances necessitated his removal a few months
afterwards; and it was then found that the oil-cloth had
grown, so to speak, to the wood flooring, and had to be
taken off with a chisel: the dry rot had been engendered
merely on the surface of the floor boards, as they were
sound below as well as the joists: air bricks were in the
front wall.</p>

<p>We have seen many instances of dry rot in <i>passages</i>,
where oiled floor-cloth has been nailed down and not been
disturbed for two or three years.</p>

<p>In ordinary houses, where floor-cloth is laid down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
<i>front</i> kitchen, no ventilation under the floors, and a fire
burning every day in the stove, dry rot often appears.
In the <i>back</i> kitchen, where there is no floor-cloth, and only
an occasional fire, it rarely appears. The air is warm and
stagnant under one floor, and cold and stagnant under
the other: at the temperature of 32° to 40° the progress
of dry rot is very slow.</p>

<p>And how does <i>kamptulicon</i> behave itself? The following
instances of the rapid progress of dry rot from external
circumstances have recently been communicated to us;
they show that, under favourable circumstances as to
choice of timber and seasoning, this fungus growth can
be readily produced by <i>casing-in</i> the timber with substances
impervious, or nearly so, to air.</p>

<p>At No. 29, Mincing Lane, London, in <i>two</i> out of three
rooms on the <i>first</i> floor, upon a fire-proof floor constructed
on the Fox and Barrett principle (of iron joists and
concrete with yellow pine sleepers, on strips of wood
bedded in cement, to which were nailed the yellow pine
floor-boards) kamptulicon was nailed down by the tenant’s
orders. In less than nine months the whole of the wood
sleepers, and strips of wood, as well as the boards, were
seriously injured by dry rot; whilst the third room floor,
which had been covered with a carpet, was perfectly
sound.</p>

<p>At No. 79, Gracechurch Street, London, a room on the
second floor was inhabited, as soon as finished, by a tenant
who had kamptulicon laid down. This floor was formed
in the ordinary way, with the usual sound boarding of
strips of wood, and concrete two inches thick filled in on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the same, leaving a space of about two inches under the
floor boards. The floor was seriously decayed by dry rot
in a few months down to the level of the concrete pugging,
below which it remained sound, and could be pulled
up with the hand.</p>

<p>We will now leave oil-cloth and kamptulicon, and try
what “Keene’s cement” will do for an “air-tight” partition
of a house.</p>

<p>At No. 16, Mark Lane, London, a partition was constructed
of sound yellow deal quarters, covered externally
with “Keene’s cement, on lath, both sides.” It was
removed about two years after its construction, when it
was found that the timber was completely <i>perished from
dry rot</i>; so much so, that the timbers parted in the middle
in places, and were for some time afterwards moist.</p>

<p>It is still unfortunately the custom to keep up the old
absurd fashion of disguising woods, instead of revealing
their natural beauties. Instead of wasting time in perfect
imitations of scarce or dear woods, it would be much
better to employ the same amount of time in fully developing
the natural characteristics of many of our native
woods, now destined for decorative purposes because they
are cheap and common; although many of our very commonest
woods are very beautifully grained, but their excellences
for ornamentation are lost because our decorators
have not studied the best mode of developing their
beauties. Who would wish that stained deal should be
painted in imitation of oak? or that the other materials
of a less costly and inferior order should have been painted
over instead of their natural faces being exposed to view?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
There are beauties in all the materials used. The inferior
serve to set off by comparison the more costly, and
increase their effect. The red, yellow, and white veins of
the pine timber are beautiful: the shavings are like silk
ribbons, which only nature could vein after that fashion,
and to imitate which would puzzle all the <i>tapissiers</i> of the
Rue Mouffetard, in Paris.</p>

<p>Why should not light and dark woods be commonly used
in combination with each other in our joinery? Wood may
be stained of various shades, from light to dark. The dirt
or dust does not show more on stained wood than it does
on paint, and can be as easily cleaned and refreshed by
periodical coats of varnish. Those parts subjected to constant
wear and tear can be protected by more durable
materials, such as finger-plates, &amp;c. Oak can be stained
dark, almost black, by means of bichromate of potash
diluted with water. Wash the wood over with a solution
of gallic acid of any required strength, and allow it to
thoroughly dry. To complete the process, wash with a
solution of iron in the form of “tincture of steel,” or a
decoction of vinegar and iron filings, and a deep and good
stain will be the result. If a positive black is required,
wash the wood over with gallic acid and water two or
three times, allowing it to dry between every coat; the
staining with the iron solution may be repeated. Raw
linseed oil will stay the darker process at any stage.</p>

<p>Doors made up of light deal, and varied in the staining,
would look as well as the ordinary graining. Good and
well-seasoned materials would have to be used, and the
joiners’ work well fitted and constructed. Mouldings of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
superior character, and in some cases gilt, might be used
in the panels, &amp;c. For doors, plain oak should be used for
the stiles and rails, and pollard oak for the panels. If
rose-wood or satin-wood be used, the straight-grained wood
is the best adapted for stiles and rails; and for mahogany
doors, the lights and shades in the panels should be
stronger than in the stiles and rails.</p>

<p>Dark and durable woods might be used in parts most
exposed to wear and tear.</p>

<p>Treads of stairs might be framed with oak nosings, if
not at first, at least when necessary to repair the nosings.</p>

<p>Skirtings could be varied by using dark and hard woods
for the lower part or plinth, lighter wood above, and
finished with superior mouldings. It must, however, be
remembered that, contrary to the rule that holds good
with regard to most substances, the colours of the generality
of woods become considerably <i>darker</i> by exposure
to the light; allowance would therefore have to be made
for this. All the woodwork <i>must</i>, previously to being
fixed, be well seasoned.</p>

<p>The practice here recommended would be more expensive
than the common method of painting, but in many
cases it would be better than graining, and cheaper in the
long run. Oak wainscot and Honduras mahogany doors
are twice the price of deal doors; Spanish mahogany
three times the price. When we consider that by using
the natural woods, French polished, we save the cost of
four coats of paint and graining (the customary modes),
the difference in price is very small. An extra 50<i>l.</i> laid
out on a 500<i>l.</i> house would give some rooms varnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and rubbed fittings, without paint. Would it not be
worth the outlay? It may be said that spots of grease
and stains would soon disfigure the bare wood; if so, they
could easily be removed by the following process: Take
a quarter of a pound of fuller’s earth, and a quarter of a
pound of pearlash, and boil them in a quart of soft water,
and, while hot, lay the composition on the greased parts,
allowing it to remain on them for ten or twelve hours;
after which it may be washed off with fine sand and water.
If a floor be much spotted with grease, it should be completely
washed over with this mixture, and allowed to
remain for twenty-four hours before it is removed.</p>

<p>Let us consider how we paint our doors, cupboards, &amp;c.,
at the present time. For our best houses, the stiles of our
doors are painted French white; and the panels, pink, or
salmon colour! For cheaper houses, the doors, cupboards,
window linings, &amp;c., are generally two shades of what is
called “stone colour” (as if stone was always the same
colour), and badly executed into the bargain: the best
rooms having the woodwork grained in imitation of oak,
or satin-wood, &amp;c. And such imitations! Mahogany and
oak are now even imitated on leather and paper-hangings.
Wood, well and cleanly varnished, stained, or, better still,
French polished, must surely look better than these daubs.
But French polish is not extensively used in England: it
is confined to cabinet pieces and furniture, except in the
houses of the aristocracy. Clean, colourless varnish ought
to be more generally used to finish off our woodwork,
instead of the painting now so common. The varnish
should be clean and colourless, as the yellow colour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
ordinary varnishes greatly interferes with the tints of the
light woods.</p>

<p>In the Imperial Palace, at Berlin, one or two of the
Emperor’s private rooms are entirely fitted up with deal
fittings; doors, windows, shutters, and everything else of
fir-wood. “Common deal,” if well selected, is beautiful,
cheap, and pleasing.</p>

<p>We have seen the offices of Herr Krauss (architect to
Prince and Princess Louis of Hesse), who resides at
Mayence, and they are fitted up, or rather the walls and
ceilings are lined, with picked pitch pine-wood, parts
being carved, and the whole French polished, and the
effect is much superior to any paint, be it “stone colour,”
“salmon colour,” or even “French white.”</p>

<p>The reception-room, where the Emperor of Germany
usually transacts business with his ministers, and receives
deputations, &amp;c., as well as the adjoining cabinets, are
fitted with deal, not grained and painted, but well French
polished. The wood is, of course, carefully selected, carefully
wrought, and excellently French polished, which is
the great secret of the business. In France, it is a very
common practice to polish and wax floors.</p>

<p>The late Sir Anthony Carlisle had the interior woodwork
of his house, in Langham Place, London, varnished
throughout, and the effect of the varnished deal was very
like satin-wood.</p>

<p>About forty years since, Mr. J. G. Crace, when engaged
on the decoration of the Duke of Hamilton’s house, in the
Isle of Arran, found the woodwork of red pine so free from
knots, and so well executed, that instead of painting it, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
had it only varnished. It was a great success, and ten
years after looked nearly as well as when first done.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Owen Jones, whose works on colour decoration
are well known, was employed a few years since by
Mr. Alfred Morrisson to decorate his town and country
houses. At the country house (Fonthill House), Mr. Jones
built a room for the display of Chinese egg-shell pottery,
the chimneypiece and fittings being entirely of ebony,
inlaid with ivory, and the ceiling of wood, panelled and
inlaid, the mouldings being black and gold. At the town
house, in Carlton House Terrace, London, the woodwork of
the panelling, dadoes, doors, architraves, window-shutters,
and all the rooms on the ground and first floors is inlaid,
from designs by Mr. Jones, with various woods of different
kinds, the colours of which were carefully selected by him,
with a view to perfect harmony of colouring.</p>

<p>A house has recently been erected (from the designs
of Mr. J. W. McLaughlin, architect) near Cincinnati, Ohio,
United States, which is a perfect model with regard to
the amount of woodwork used. The walls of the <i>hall</i>
are finished with walnut wainscoting; the fireplace is an
open one, with a walnut mantelpiece, surmounted by
three statues, Peace, Plenty, and Harmony, supporting
the carved wooden cornice. The Elizabethan <i>staircase</i>
has carved panels of maple. The <i>library</i> is wainscoted
to the ceiling in black walnut, inlaid with ebony. The
<i>dining room</i> is also wainscoted in the richest style in
oak, with polished mahogany panels. The <i>floors</i> are of
marquetry, of different woods and patterns. The <i>chamber
story</i> is finished in oak and walnut, with mahogany in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the panels. The <i>entire interior</i> finish of the house is of
hard wood, <i>varnished and rubbed</i> in cabinet style. This
is as it should be for a gentleman’s residence.</p>

<p>We believe the largest house now being erected in
London is from the designs of Mr. Knowles, jun., for
Baron Albert Grant, at Kensington. We have not seen
it, but we hope it will be finished in the Cincinnati
style, as far as regards the amount of ornamental woods
used.</p>

<p>There is a cynical French proverb, which says, “When
we cannot have what we love, we must love what we have.”
But surely this cynical proverb cannot be applied to
“stone colour” paint on wood. The Japanese, however,
some years since, determined not to follow this advice, for
when the English Government, at Admiral Sterling’s suggestion,
sent to the Tycoon a very fine steam vessel, the
Japanese (who abhor paint about their ships) immediately
commenced to scrub off the paint. According to Sir
Rutherford Alcock, they have been steadily engaged in
scrubbing it off ever since the boat has come into their
possession, and by dint of labour and perseverance have
nearly succeeded. All the fine imitation satin-wood and
the gilt work have been reduced to a very forlorn
state. The Japanese not only decline to follow advice,
but they are a very difficult race of people from whom
to obtain correct information. When Mr. Veitch was at
Yeddo, on a visit to the Legation, in quest of botanical
specimens, he saw a pine-tree from which he desired a
few seeds. “Oh,” said the inevitable yaconins, “those
trees <i>have no seed</i>!”&mdash;“But there they are,” replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
unreasonable botanist, pointing to some. “Ah, yes, true;
but they <i>will not grow</i>,” was the reply.</p>

<p>If we must take our fashions from royalty and the aristocracy,
and if we must go abroad for them, surely the
above examples will suffice; but if we must have paint,
then the preservative solution, now being extensively used
in the restoration and renovation of St. Paul’s Cathedral,
under the superintendence of Mr. F. C. Penrose, the architect
to the Dean and Chapter, appears to possess several
good qualities. The preservative solution, which is manufactured
by the Indestructible Paint Company, is said
to be as follows: 1st, that it is colourless and invisible;
2nd, in no way does it alter the appearance of the surface;
3rd, it prevents the growth of vegetation; and 4th, that it
resists the action of the atmosphere and changes of weather,
not only preventing but also arresting decay.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the wood selected (if not to be
painted) should be well grown, and from a fully developed
tree, where all the fibres or grain are distinctly marked.
The beauty of the wood, when properly treated, consists
in the brilliant manner in which the rich, deep yellow
streaks or layers of the hard wood are developed under the
hands of the skilful polisher. These yellow veins show
through the polish like clear and beautifully marked
streaks of amber; and strongly reflecting the light, they
produce a very pleasing effect. The yellow, variegated,
hard part of the wood forms a very excellent contrast to
the delicate whiteness of the softer parts of the board;
and, if skilfully selected, the effect will be much admired,
and certainly preferred to the best imitation of the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
rare and expensive woods. In arranging doors, panels, &amp;c.,
much will, of course, depend in selecting the wood, in
placing the best parts in the panels, so that when polished
the most pleasing effects will be produced. Much, too,
depends on skilful workmanship and smooth finish, which
can only be obtained by care, and using well-seasoned
wood; but this is the case with all species of wood.</p>

<p>Should any young architect, after reading the preceding
remarks, be desirous of employing natural woods in his
building works, we advise him, before he attempts this
kind of colour decoration, to study Mr. Owen Jones’
lecture on “Colour in the Decorative Arts,” delivered
before the Society of Arts, 1852; and likewise M. Chevreul’s
‘Laws of the Simultaneous Contrast of Colours’; we
also recommend him to&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Use <i>moderate</i> things elegantly, and <i>elegant</i> things moderately.</p>

</div>

<p>Oak, walnut, maple, elm, and some other woods become
of very dark colour, but can be made to receive a fine
polish, and could often be employed for panels with good
effect. In some cases there is great contrast of tint in the
same log after preparation, so that these might be inapplicable
except in smaller pieces, or perhaps by applying the
process after the work has been made; but sycamore,
beech, and some other woods are generally uniform, except
as regards the previous grain of the wood.</p>

<p>As to the matter of showing the end of the grain,
according to the Gothic principle the beauty of a wood
consists in showing the end of the grain; but, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
time, the classic principle is that there is a greater beauty
in the side way of the grain than in the end way.</p>

<p>Although varnish and polish both form a glazing, and
give a lustre to the wood they cover, as well as heighten
the colours of the wood, yet from their want of consistence
they are liable to yield to any shrinking or swelling, rising
in scales or cracking, when much knocked about. Waxing,
on the contrary, resists percussion, but it does not possess
in the same degree as varnish the property of giving
lustre to the bodies on which it is applied; any accidents,
however, to its polish are easily repaired by rubbing.</p>

<p>The woodwork of the Swiss Cottage, at the late Colosseum,
London, in the Regent’s Park, was only varnished.</p>

<p>In using stain on any description of wood, the stain
should always be allowed to get quite dry before sizing,
as that gives it a fair chance of striking into the wood.
Glue size is the best for stained work, made so thin that
there is no fear of putting it on in patches. After the
size is quite dry also, varnish; and if the first coat does
not stand out quite sufficiently to please the eye, give
it a second coat. Some persons use stain and varnish
together, doing away with size; but this is a very poor
method, for should the wood get scratched or damaged in
any way, the varnish and stain come off together, leaving
a white place, if it be white wood that is stained. A
painter who has been in the trade forty years, recently
remarked to us, “You must size, or else the varnish
won’t come out; it won’t show that it <i>is</i> varnish; the
wood soaks it up; while there is any suction going on
the varnish’ll go in. The sizing stops all suction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>A great many experiments and attempts have been
made at different times to colour wood. John of Verona
first conceived the idea. The celebrated B. Pallissy investigated
the cause of the veins, &amp;c., in wood, and tried
mordant solutions applied to the surface, wetting the surface
with certain acids, immersing the wood in water to
bring out the veinage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Ebony has often been imitated by penetrating sycamore,
plane, and lime woods to a certain depth with pyrolignite
of iron, gall-nuts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Werner, in 1812, obtained great success at Dijon in
colouring the woods by filtration. Marloye, in 1833, constructed
a machine to colour wood by placing it erect in a
cylinder, sucking out the air at one end, and forcing up
the colouring solution through the other. He gave the
credit of this to Bréant. Marloye has manufactured
many mathematical instruments of wood coloured in this
way, <i>which does not warp</i>.</p>

<p>If we could afford the space, we would willingly give
a <i>résumé</i> of the attempts of well known experimentalists
to colour wood. We can only give the year and name
in each case:</p>

<ul>
<li>1709. Magnol.</li>
<li>1733. La Baisse.</li>
<li>1735. Hales.</li>
<li>1735. Buffon.</li>
<li>1754. Bonnet.</li>
<li>1758. Du Hamel.</li>
<li>1804. Saussure.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the recent war between France and Germany,
the latter country advanced matters, their supplies of
coloured woods from France being gone.</p>

<p>As we have made so many remarks against painting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
wood, it is only right that we should give some description
of it, which we will now do.</p>

<p>House painting, according to Mr. W. Papworth, in his
lecture on “Fir, Deal, and House Painting,” 1857, did
not come into <i>general</i> use until about the period of
William and Mary, and Anne, up to which time either
colouring by distemper or by whitewash had been in
vogue for plaster work, leaving inside woodwork more or
less untouched.</p>

<p>We think, without wishing to think <i>too loud</i>, that house
painting was invented by <i>a bad builder</i>, in the seventeenth
century, because</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Putty and paint cover a multitude of sins.</p>

</div>

<p>The process of graining and marbling may be traced
back as far at least as the time of James III. of Scotland
(1567-1603), during whose reign a room of Hopetown
Tower was painted in imitation of marble. Before that
period, imitations were done in “stone” colour, “marble”
colour, wainscot colour, &amp;c. In 1676, marbling was
executed as well as imitations of olive and walnut woods;
and in 1688 tortoise-shell was copied on battens and
mouldings. Mahogany was imitated in 1815, and maple
wood in 1817. But why imitate mahogany, when the
grain of the wood differs so much in texture, and in the
appearance of the different and beautiful shades, technically
termed <i>roe</i>, <i>broken roe</i>, <i>bold roe</i>, <i>mottle</i>, <i>faint mottle</i>,
and <i>dapple</i>.</p>

<p>The following description will give the reader some
idea of ordinary painting. The woodwork having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
prepared for fixing, has first to undergo the process of
“knotting,” in order to prevent the turpentine in the
knots of fir-wood from passing through the several coats
of paint. One method for best work is to cut out the knot
whilst the work is at the bench to a slight depth, and to
fill up the hole with a stiff putty made of white lead,
japan, and turpentine. There are many ways of killing
the knots: the best and surest is to cover them with gold
or silver leaf. Sometimes a lump of fresh slaked lime is
laid on for about twenty-four hours, then scraped off, a
coating of “size knotting” applied, and if not sufficiently
killed, they are coated with red and white lead in linseed
oil, and rubbed down when dry. The general method is
to cover the parts with size knotting, which is a preparation
of red lead, white lead, and whitening, made into
a thin paste with size. The most common mode is to
paint them with red ochre, which is worth nothing. The
next process is that of priming, which consists in giving a
coat of white and red lead, and a little dryers in linseed
oil. This is the first coat, and upon which the look of the
paint on completion depends. This first, or priming coat,
is put on before “stopping” the work, should that process
be required. It consists in filling up with putty any
cracks or other imperfections on the surface of the wood.
If the putty used in the process of stopping be introduced
before the first coat of colour is laid on, it
becomes loose when dry. After this first coat, pumicing
is resorted to for removing all irregularities from the
surface. It is worth recollecting that <i>old</i> white lead
is much superior to new for all painting operations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
A smooth surface being thus obtained, the second coat is
given, consisting of white lead and oil: about one-fourth
part of turpentine is sometimes added for quick work.
If four coats are to be laid on, this second one has sometimes
a proportion of red lead, amounting to a flesh
colour; but if only three, it is generally made to assume
the tint of the finishing coat. It should have a good
body, and be laid even. This coat, when thoroughly dry
and hard, is, in best work, rubbed down with fine sand
paper, and then the third coat, or “ground colour,” applied
of a somewhat darker tint than wanted when finished,
having sufficient oil for easy working, but not too fluid:
thus two-thirds oil, and one-third turpentine. The
“flatting” coat follows, the object of which is to prevent
the gloss or glaze of the oil, and to obtain a flat, dead
appearance. White lead is mixed with turpentine, to
which a little copal is sometimes added, and when the
tint is put in it is always made lighter than the ground
colour, or it would, when finished, appear in a series of
shades and stripes. Flatting must be executed quickly,
and the brush is generally, if not always, carried up the
work, and not across it.</p>

<p>To clean paint, raw alkalies should not be used, as they
will infallibly take off the flatting coat. The best mode
of cleaning is by means of good soap, not too strong, laid
on with a large brush, so as to make a lather: this should
be washed off clean with a sponge, and wiped dry with a
leather.</p>

<p>We must draw to a conclusion.</p>

<p>One cause of the decay of modern buildings, and frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
cases of dry rot, is owing to the employment of bad
builders. We advise the non-professional reader to employ
an architect or surveyor when he desires to speculate
in bricks and mortar: it is the cheapest course. If he
doubts the truth of what we have written, we can assure
him he will be a mere child in the hands of a bad or
scamping builder; that is to say, he will obtain a badly-erected
house,&mdash;a cheap contract, and a long bill of
extras.</p>

<p>There are <i>seven</i> classes of bad builders&mdash;1st, the <i>bad
builder</i> who does not know his business; 2nd, the <i>bad
builder</i> who has no money to carry it on with; 3rd, the
<i>partial</i> scamp; 4th, the <i>regular</i> scamp; 5th, the <i>thorough</i>
scamp; 6th, the “<i>jerry</i>” builder; and 7th, the <i>vagabond</i>.
There is an instance of the latter class given by Mr.
Menzies in his fine work on ‘Windsor Park,’ 1864. We
could give examples of all these classes, and draw the
line between each class, impossible as it may seem: they
are always looking out for customers, <i>without architects</i>.</p>

<p>We could assist the non-professional reader by quoting
the advice given by several architects (viz. Sir C. Wren,
C. Barry, B. Smirke, W. Chambers, and W. Tite) relative
to buildings, but there is a Danish proverb which, translated
into English, runs as follows: “He who builds
according to every man’s advice will have a crooked
house.”</p>

<p>As the destruction of timber by fungi has been called the
<i>vegetable</i> rot, it may not be inappropriate to term the destruction
of wood by various worms and insects, the
<i>animal</i> rot.</p>

<p>We have <i>four natural enemies</i> to deal with: 1st, the
<i>dry rot</i>, that attacks our houses, &amp;c.; 2nd, the <i>worms</i>, or
boring animals, which destroy our ships and harbours;
3rd, the <i>rust</i>, that eats our iron; and 4th, the <i>moisture
and gases</i>, that destroy our stone.</p>

<p>There are three classes of destructive insects which prey
upon timber trees, founded upon the manner in which they
carry on their operations&mdash;viz. those which feed upon the
leaves and tender shoots; those which feed upon the bark
and the albumen; and those which feed upon the heart-wood.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that some of the insects which feed
upon the heart of wood do not cease their ravages upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the removal of the tree; but that, on the contrary, the
<i>Cossus syrex</i>, of our indigenous fauna, and the larvæ of
the <i>Callidium bajutum</i>, which are often found in imported
timber, continue to devour the wood long after it has
been inserted in buildings. There seem to be very few
means of defence against this class of destructive agents;
and very few trustworthy indications of their existence,
or of the extent of the ravages they have committed,
are to be discovered externally; and it thus frequently
happens that a sound, hearty-looking stick of timber may
be so seriously bored by these insects as to be of comparatively
little value for building purposes of any description.
The soft and tender woods, and such as are of a
saccharine nature in their juices, are the most liable to be
assailed by worms; those which are bitter are generally,
if not invariably, exempt; it is obvious, therefore, that
those palatable juices, which are so conducive to their
production and propagation, should be got rid of by
thorough seasoning, and, if further precaution be necessary,
that the infusion of some bitter decoction into the
pores of the wood will be an effectual preventive; and
for which those woods that are of a regular grain afford
sufficient facilities. Ash, if felled when abounding in sap,
is very subject to worms; beech, under similar circumstances,
is also liable to their attacks; likewise alder and
birch; in these woods water seasoning is sometimes found
to be a good preventive; the sapwood of oak is also thus
improved; the silver fir is subject to them; the sycamore
is rather so; alder is said when dry to be very susceptible
of engendering them; the cedar, walnut, plane, cypress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and mahogany are examples of woods which discourage
their advances. It has been stated that Robert Stevenson
(not the son of the “Father of Railways”), of Edinburgh,
at Bell Rock Lighthouse (of which he was engineer),
between 1814 and 1843, found that greenheart wood,
beef wood, and bullet tree were not perforated by the
<i>Teredo navalis</i>, and teak but slightly so. Later experiments
show that the “jarrah” of the East, also, is not
attacked. Lignum vitæ is said to be exempt. The cost
of these woods prevents their general use.</p>

<p>In 1810, Stevenson first noticed the <i>teredo</i> in piles, and
specimens of the creatures in wood were sent to Dr. Leach,
of the British Museum, in 1811, who examined them, and
noticed their peculiarities. Stevenson, settled on Bell
Rock during many years (like a new Robinson Crusoe),
was enabled to watch the injuries done to the piles by the
<i>teredo</i>. With piles which had been subjected to Kyan’s
process before immersion, the wood was attacked at the
end of the twenty-eighth month, and was entirely destroyed
in the seventh month of the fifth year. With
Payne’s, it lasted a year longer.</p>

<p>We can give the names of those who have given much
time and attention to this subject. At the bottom of this

<p>The termite, or white ant, is the most destructive insect
to timber on land, whilst the teredo reigns supreme of sea
worms in the sea. The former we shall treat of in our
next chapter, the latter we propose considering at some
length in this.</p>

<p>The marine worm, of which there are accounts in all
parts of the world, has been known, by its effects, for
hundreds of years; indeed, Ovid spoke of it nineteen
hundred years ago, and it is even mentioned by Homer.
Fossil <i>terredines</i> of great antiquity have been found near
Southend; also pieces of petrified wood from the greensand,
near Lyme and Sidmouth, bored by ancient species
of <i>teredo</i>; also from Bath, and from Doulting, near Shepton
Mallet, specimens of oolite, with petrified corallines
in it, pierced by boring shells.</p>

<p>It is said that this worm is a native of India, and that
it was introduced to Holland some 200 years ago, from
whence it has spread through the ports of northern
Europe.</p>

<p>The <i>Teredo navalis</i><a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> is very destructive to harbour works
and piling. The Southampton water is particularly infested
with it; in fact, the <i>teredo</i> is found in every port
to which coals are carried south of the Tees; in the
Thames, as high up as Gravesend; and northward as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
as Whitby. It is also found at Ryde, Brighton, and
Dover. Traces of the ravages of the <i>Teredo navalis</i>, and
of the <i>Limnoria terebrans</i>, have at various periods been
found from the north of Scotland and Ireland, on almost
every coast, to the Cape of Good Hope and Van Dieman’s
Land, in the eastern hemisphere; and, in the western
hemisphere, from the river St. Lawrence to Staten Island,
near Terra del Fuego, almost in the Polar Sea; so that
although this maritime scourge is rifest in warm climates,
yet cold latitudes are not exempt from it.</p>

<p>At the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, may be seen the
destructive <i>Teredo navalis</i> in a bottle, and there may
also be seen mahogany perforated by it, and fir piles from
Lowestoft Harbour, which were rendered useless by the
ravages of the worm and the <i>limnoria</i> three years after
they were driven, showing the necessity of defending
timber intended for marine construction. A specimen of
American oak from the dock gates of Lowestoft Harbour,
which had been four years under water, and a part of a
fir-pile from the dockyard creek at Sevastopol, also
show the destructive powers of the <i>teredo</i>. At the South
Kensington and British Museums, London, specimens of
this worm may also be seen, as well as pieces of timber
perforated by it.</p>

<p>The bottoms of ships, and timbers exposed to the action
of the sea, are often destroyed by the <i>teredo</i>.</p>

<p>The gunboats constructed during the Crimean war
suffered far more from dry rot and the <i>teredo</i> than the
shot and shell of the Russians. One cannot even guess
at the mischief perpetrated every year all along our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
shores, in docks and harbours, by the boring animals that
penetrate all woods not specially protected. We cannot
count the number of the ships that have foundered at
sea, owing to those few inches of timber, on which all depended,
being pierced or destroyed by the worm or fungus.</p>

<p>In the short space of twelve years these destructive
worms were known to make such havoc in the fir piles
of a bridge at Teignmouth, that the whole bridge fell
suddenly, and had to be totally reconstructed.</p>

<p>The wooden piers of Bridlington were nearly wholly
destroyed by worms; and the pile fenders on the stone
piers at Scarborough were generally cut through in a few
years.</p>

<p>At Dunkirk, wooden jetties are so speedily eaten away
that they require renewal every twelve or fifteen years.
At Havre, a stockade was entirely destroyed in six months.
At Lorient, wood only lasts about three years in the sea-water;
and at Aix, the hull of a stranded vessel was found
to have lost half its weight in six months, from the
ravages of these animals.</p>

<p>The reason why Balaclava, in Russia, is not a place of
considerable mercantile importance is owing in a great
measure to the destructive ravages of the worms with
which its waters are infested, and by which the hulls of
ships remaining there for any length of time become
perforated.</p>

<p>The piles of the jetties in Colombo Harbour, Ceylon,
which are mostly of satin-wood, and about 14 inches in
diameter, are so pierced by these worms in the course of
twelve months as to require renewal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The cofferdam at Sheerness was destroyed by the <i>teredo</i>.
After a time, it was no uncommon occurrence to see several
piles, apparently sound, floated away at each tide; indeed,
they were so thoroughly perforated by the <i>teredo</i> that in
still weather, by putting the ear to the side of the pile, the
worms could be heard at their boring labours.</p>

<p>The almost total destruction of the pier-head of the old
Southend Pier in a few years, is another instance of the
serious damages these worms cause. The old pier-head
was erected in the year 1833, and in three years the
majority of the wooden piles had been almost destroyed,
and at the end of ten years, in addition to the piles being
all eaten through by the worms, the whole structure had
sunk 9 inches at the western end, so that in a short time
it would have fallen. The materials with which the work
was constructed were of good quality, the fir being Memel,
and the oak of English growth; it was all perfectly sound
in those places were the <i>teredo</i> had not attacked it, and
indeed portions of it were again used in the construction
of the extension of the pier. The whole of the timber
work was well coated with pitch and tar previously to
being fixed, but notwithstanding these precautions, and an
apparent determination to protect the pier-head by copper
sheathing, brushing, cleaning, and constant watchfulness,
the <i>teredo</i> made its appearance, and committed such ravages
that the entire destruction of the pier-head soon appeared
inevitable. The <i>Teredo navalis</i> first showed itself six months
after the completion of the work, and was reported within
twelve months to have seriously injured the piles above
the copper, whilst at about low-water mark, of neap tides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
nearly all the piles exhibited appearances of destruction, the
<i>limnoria</i>, as well as the <i>teredo</i>, having seriously attacked
them; and in less than four years from the completion of
the pier-head, they had progressed in their work to such
an extent that some of the piles were entirely eaten
through, both above and below the copper sheathing; in
consequence of this the stability of the structure was
materially injured, and, on examination, it was discovered
that the ground had been considerably washed away by
the action of the sea, and that the piles below the copper
were exposed to the action of the <i>teredo</i>.</p>

<p>The first appearances of the <i>Teredo navalis</i> are somewhat
singular, inasmuch as the wood which has been perforated
by it presents to the casual observer no symptom of destruction
on the surface, nor are the animals themselves
visible, until the outer part of the wood has been broken
away, when their shelly habitations come in sight, and
show the perfect honeycomb they have formed; on a
closer examination of the wood, however, a number of
minute perforations are discovered on the surface, generally
covered with a slimy matter; and on opening the
wood at one of these, and tracing it, the tail of the animal
is immediately found, and after various windings and turnings,
the head is discovered, which, in some cases, is as
much as 3 feet from the point of entrance; sometimes it
will happen, especially if the wood has been much eaten,
that their shelly tubes are partly visible on the surface,
but this is rare; they enter at the surface, and bore in
every direction, both with and against the grain of the
wood, growing in size as they proceed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rev. W. Wood writes, in 1863: “I have now before
me a portion of the pier at Yarmouth, which is so honeycombed
by this terrible creature that it can be crushed
between the hands as if it were paper, and in many places
the wood is not thicker than ordinary foolscap. This piece
was broken off by a steamer which accidentally ran against
it; and so completely is it tunnelled, that although it
measures 7 inches in length and about 11 in circumference,
its weight is under 4 ounces, a considerable portion of
even that weight being due to the shelly tubes of the
destroyers.”</p>

<p>The eggs of the <i>teredo</i> affix themselves to the wood they
are washed against, are then hatched, and the worm commences
boring; each individual serves by itself for the
propagation of the species; and they rarely injure each
other’s habitations. Any timber, constantly under water,
but not exposed to the action of the air at the fall of the
tide, is extremely likely to be destroyed by them. They
appear to enter the wood obliquely, to take the grain of
the fibre, and more generally to bore with it downwards,
where the perforations are left dry at low water.</p>

<p>It has been stated by some authorities that the <i>teredo</i> is
only a destructive creature, and seeks the wood as a
shelter, from instinctive dread of some larger animals, but
there is no doubt this insect feeds upon wood. Mr. John
Paton, C.E. (to whom we are indebted for much information
on these worms), in conjunction with Mr. Newport, the
eminent physiologist and anatomist, on carefully dissecting
this animal for the purpose of ascertaining its general
character, and more particularly the nature of its food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
found digested portions of wood in its body, so that there
is no doubt that the <i>teredo</i> does feed upon the particles of
the wood, and to this its rapid and extraordinary growth
must be mainly attributed.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Teredo navalis</i>, or, as it is sometimes called, the
Ship Worm, is one of the <i>Acephalous mollusca</i>, order Conchifera,
and of the family of the <i>Pholadariæ</i>. It is of an
elongated vermiform shape, the large anterior part of which
constitutes the boring apparatus, and contains the organs of
digestion, and the posterior, gradually diminishing in size,
those of respiration. The body is covered with a transparent
skin, through which the motion of the intestines
and other remarkable peculiarities are plainly visible.
The posterior or tail portion is armed at its extremity,
with two shells, and has projecting from it a pair of
tubular organs, through which the water enters, for the purpose
of respiration; this portion is always in the direction
of the surface, and apparently in immediate contact with
the water, but does not bore. The anterior portion of the
animal is that by which it penetrates the wood, being well
armed for the purpose by having, on each side, a pair of
strong valves, formed of two pieces, perfectly distinct from
one another; the larger piece protects the sides and surface
of the extremities, and has a shelly structure projecting
from the interior, to which the muscles are attached; the
smaller piece is more convex, and covers that part which
should be regarded as the anterior surface of boring. This
portion of the shell is deeply carniated, and seems to constitute
the boring apparatus. The shells form an envelop
around the external tegument of the animal, which even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
surrounds the foot, or part by which it adheres to the
wood. The neck is provided with powerful muscles. The
manner in which it appears to perforate the wood is by a
rotary motion of the foot, carrying round the shells, and
thus making those parts act as an auger, which is kept, or
retained in connection with the wood, by the strong adherence
of the foot. The particles of wood removed by this
continued action of the foot, and the valves, are engorged
by the animal, for between the junction of the two large
shells there is a longitudinal fissure in the foot, which
appears to be formed by a fold of this portion of the two
sides, thus forming a canal to the oral orifice, and along
which the particles of wood bored out, are conveyed to
the mouth. The mouth, or entrance to the digestive
organs, is of a funnel shape, and consists of a soft, or
membraneous surface, capable of being enlarged, and leading
into an œsophagus, which passes backwards towards
the dorsal surface of the animal. At or near the termination
of the œsophagus, there is a glandular organ, the use
of which is possibly to secrete a fluid for assisting in the
digestion of the wood, and not, as has been supposed, to
act as a solvent; for if such were the case, it would most
probably be situated at its commencement instead of at its
termination. At a short distance behind this organ are
two other large glandular bodies, the use of which may
also be to secrete fluid for the purpose of digestion. The
œsophagus terminates in a large dilatation, into which
these organs pour their contents; at its posterior end the
canal is dilated into a very large elongated sac, which
extends backwards to about one-fourth of the length of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the whole animal, and is filled with food, while from its
anterior, or upper surface, it has an oval, muscular formation,
from which the alimentary canal is continued forwards,
and, after making a few turns, passes backwards, in
an almost direct line, on the upper surface of the large sac,
again passing backwards and forwards, until it finally
arrives at its termination, which it passes round, and then
proceeds, in a direct line, to the anal outlet. In the lower
portion of the œsophagus, and also in the sac, distinct portions
of woody fibre of an extremely minute character
were found by the aid of the microscope of a power of
three hundred, and this was the character of the whole
of the contents of the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>The <i>teredo</i> lines the passage in the wood with a hard
shell; this shell is formed around, but does not adhere to
the body; it is secreted by the external covering, which,
in its first formation, is extremely fragile, but becomes
hardened by contact with the water, and adheres to the
wood, from which it may, however, be easily detached.
The interior of this shell is not filled by the body of the
<i>teredo</i>, but a large space around it is occupied with water,
admitted through the small orifice in the surface of the
wood through which the animal first entered; the water
being drawn through the respiratory tubes, into the bronchial
cavity of the body, is expired again through the
same orifice, and this, in conjunction with the valve-like
shells attached at this part, induces a current round the
animal which removes the excreted fœtal matter. The
shells are very smooth on the inner surface, but are somewhat
rougher on the exterior; they are much harder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
firmer in the cells of the older animals than in the young
ones, and are composed of several annular parts, differing
greatly in their length.</p>

<p>It is no less curious than wonderful to observe the mysterious
instinct which apparently regulates the mechanical
skill of the <i>teredo</i>, its own body supplying it with an implement
of such admirable consistency and adaptation as
to enable it to excavate a habitation for itself, so accurately
formed that to a casual observer it would appear a mystery
how so perfect a circle could be produced. It is only
on examination that the raised and hollow parts of the
wood become visible, and explain, in some degree, the
auger-shaped contrivance that has been used for the purpose
of perforating.</p>

<p>It has already been stated, that the wood is perforated
by a rotary motion of the foot, the adhering part of which
acts as a fulcrum, carrying round the shells, and thus
giving immense power to the animal in its operations.</p>

<p>It is said that when Brunei was considering how to construct
the Thames Tunnel, he was one day “passing through
the dockyard (at Chatham, where he was employed by
Government), when his attention was attracted to an old
piece of ship-timber which had been perforated by that
well-known destroyer of timber&mdash;the <i>Teredo navalis</i>. He
examined the perforations, and subsequently the animal.
He found it armed with a pair of strong shelly valves,
which enveloped its anterior integuments; and that, with
its foot as a fulcrum, a rotatory motion was given by
powerful muscles to the valves, which, acting on the wood
like an auger, penetrated gradually but surely; and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
as the particles were removed, they were passed through
a longitudinal fissure in the foot, which formed a canal to
the mouth, and so were engorged. To imitate the action
of this animal became Brunei’s study. ‘From these
ideas,’ said he, ‘by slow and certain methods; which,
when compared with the progress of works of art, will be
found to be much more expeditious in the end.’”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Professor Owen suggests that the power of the <i>teredo</i> to
bore into wood depends on muscular friction, the muscular
substance being perpetually renewed while the wood wastes
away, of course, without renewal. Professor Forbes, Dr.
Carpenter, and Dr. Lyon Playfair were appointed about
twenty-five years ago by the British Association to examine
into the natural history and habits of these boring animals,
but they did not arrive at any definite conclusion
as to whether the boring action of the <i>teredo</i> was mechanical
or chemical. Dr. Deshayes, on his return from
Algiers, after making accurate drawings and careful investigations,
came to the conclusion that the borings were
effected by an acid secretion. Mr. Thomson, of Belfast,
examined the operations of the <i>teredo</i> on the pier at Port
Patrick, and arrived at the same conclusion. The general
opinion, however, is that the boring action is a mechanical
one.</p>

<p>Although the <i>teredo</i> appears to penetrate all kinds of
timber, that which it seems to destroy with the greatest
ease is fir, in which it works much more speedily and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
successfully than in any other, and perhaps grows to the
greatest size. In a fir pile, taken from the old pier-head
at Southend, a worm was found 2 feet long and ¾ inch in
diameter, and indeed they have been heard of 3 feet in
length and 1 inch in diameter. The soft, porous nature
of the wood is no doubt the cause of their rapid growth,
for in oak timber they do not progress so fast, or grow to
so great a length, though in Sir Hans Sloane’s ‘History
of Jamaica’ (1725) there are accounts of these animals
destroying keels of ships made of oak, and even of cedar,
although the latter is renowned, by its smell and resin,
for resisting all kinds of worms.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Cell formed by the Teredo Navalis showing method of boring.</i></p>

</div>

<p>There is another kind of worm which is very destructive
to timber, which Smeaton observed in Bridlington piers.
This is the <span class="smcap">Timber-boring Shrimp</span>, or <span class="smcap">Gribble</span>, the
<i>Limnoria terebrans</i> (or <i>Limnoria perforata</i>, Leach), a
mollusc of the family <i>Asselotes</i>, Leach. The <i>Limnoria
terebrans</i> is very abundant around the British shores. Its
ravages were first particularly observed in the year 1810,
by the late Sir. Robert Stevenson, engineer of the Bell
Rock Lighthouse. While engaged in the erection of that
structure he found the timber of the temporary erections
to be soon destroyed by the attacks of the <i>limnoria</i>. So
little was known of the <i>limnoria</i> at the time that Dr.
Leach, a well-known naturalist, who received some specimens
from Mr. Stevenson, in 1811, declared it to be a
new and highly interesting species. In 1834, the late Dr.
John Coldstream wrote a very full and interesting description
of the creature. The <i>limnoria</i> resembles a woodlouse,
and is so small as hardly to be perceptible in the timber it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
attacks, being almost of the same colour. Small as is this
crustacean, hardly larger indeed than a grain of rice, it is
a sad pest wherever submarine timber is employed, for it
works with great energy, and its vast numbers quite compensate
for the small size of each individual; for as many
as twenty thousand will appear on the surface of a piece
of a pile only 12 inches square. It proceeds in a very
methodical manner, and makes its way obliquely inward,
unless it happens to meet a knot, when it passes round the
obstacle and resumes its former direction. The surface of
the timber being first attacked, it proceeds progressively
into the wood to the depth of about 1½ inch: the tunnels
being cylindrical, perfectly smooth winding holes, about ⅟16th
inch in diameter: it is necessary that the holes should be
filled with salt water. The outward crust formed by these
attacks then becomes macerated and rotten, and is gradually
washed away by the beating of the sea. The <i>limnoria</i>
does not work by means of any tool or instrument
like the <i>teredo</i>, but is supposed to possess some species of
dissolvent liquor, furnished by the juices of the animal
itself. Dr. Coldstream was of opinion that the animal
effects its work by the use of its mandibles. From ligneous
matter having been found in its viscera, some have
concluded that it feeds on the wood, but since other
molluscs of the same genus, <i>Pholas</i>, bore and destroy
stonework, the perforation may serve only for the animal’s
dwelling. The <i>limnoria</i> seems to prefer tender woods
but the hardest do not escape: teak and greenheart are
about the only woods it does not attack. The rate at
which the <i>limnoria</i> bores into wood in pure salt water is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
said to be about one inch in a year; but instances have
occurred in which the destruction has been much more
rapid. At Lowestoft Harbour, square 14 inch piles were
in three years eaten down to 4 inches square. At Greenock,
a pile 12 inches square was eaten through in seven
years. It is stated that a 3-inch oak plank, 12 feet long,
would be entirely destroyed in about eight years. Joists
of timber have been found at Southend Pier, 2 feet and
3 feet below high-water mark, where they had made rapid
destruction. The <i>limnoria</i> almost always works just under
neap tides; it cannot live in fresh water, and whilst it is
destroying the surface of a pile, the <i>teredo</i> is attacking
the interior: sometimes the former is found attacking the
same timber as the Chelura. As with most of these creatures,
the male <i>limnoria</i> is smaller than the female, being
about one-third her size. The female may be distinguished
by the pouch in which the eggs and afterwards the young
are carried. About six or seven young are generally found
in the pouch.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Wood-boring Shrimp</span> (<i>Chelura terebrans</i>) is a
crustacean that nearly rivals the <i>teredo</i> itself in its destructive
powers. It makes burrows into the wood, wherein
it can conceal itself, and at the same time feast upon the
fragments, as is proved by the presence of woody dust
within its interior. Its tunnels are made in an oblique
direction, not very deeply sunk below the surface, so
that after a while the action of the waves washes away
the thin shell, and leaves a number of grooves on the
surface. Below these, again, the creature bores a fresh
set of tunnels, which in their turn are washed away, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that the timber is soon destroyed in successive grooved
flakes.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Allman, its habits can be very easily
watched, as if it is merely placed in a tumbler of sea
water, together with a piece of wood, it will forthwith
proceed to work, and gnaw its way into the wood. The
apparatus with which it works this destruction is a kind of
file or rasp, which reduces the wood into minute fragments.
In this creature the jaw feet are furnished with
imperfect claws, and the tenth segment from the head is
curiously prolonged into a large and long spine. The
great flattened appendages near the tail seem to be
merely used for the purpose of cleaning its burrow of wood
dust which is not required for food. The creature always
swims on its back, and when commencing its work of
destruction, clings to the wood with the legs that proceed
from the thorax. The wood-boring shrimp is one of the
jumpers, and, like the sand hopper, can leap to a considerable
height when placed on dry land. It has been
detected in timber taken from the sea at Trieste. It was
first observed as an inhabitant of the British seas several
years ago, by Mr. Robert Ball, of Dublin, and in January,
1847, it was described by Mr. Mullins, C.E., in a paper
read before the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland,
as being very injurious to the timber piles in Kingstown
Harbour, near Dublin, and far more destructive than the
<i>Limnoria terebrans</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>We have already referred to the <i>lesson</i> the celebrated
engineer, Brunel, received from observing the <i>teredo</i>;
and we can state that architects have also received <i>lessons</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
from nature. Sir Christopher Wren constructed his spire
of St. Bride’s Church, London, after observing the construction
of the delicate shell, called <i>Turretella</i>, which
has a central column, or newel, round which the spiral
turns. Brunelleschi designed the dome of Sta. Maria, at
Florence, after studying the bones of birds and the human
form; and Michael Angelo followed Brunelleschi in constructing
the dome of St. Peter’s, Rome.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lepisma</span> is also a destructive little animal, which
begins to prey on wood in the East Indies, as soon as it is
immersed in sea water. The unprotected bottom of a boat
has been known to be eaten through by it in three or four
weeks.</p>

<p>These worms, it must be remembered, do not live
except where they have the action of the water almost
every tide, nor do they live in the parts covered with
sand. The wooden piles of embankments and sea locks
suffer very much from their depredations, and in the sea
dykes of Holland they cause very expensive annual
repairs.</p>

<p>The Dutch used to coat their piles with a mixture of
pitch and tar, and then strew small pieces of cockle and
other shells, beaten almost to powder, and mixed with
sea sand, which incrusted and armed the piles against
the attacks of the <i>teredo</i>. We believe it was a frequent
practice in London, about half a century ago, to place
small shells in the wooden pugging between the floor
joists to deaden sound.</p>

<p>Having described the chief peculiarities of these worms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
shown their mode of working, and the extent to which
their destructive powers may be carried, it will now be
necessary to consider the various schemes which have been
proposed and tried to prevent their desolating ravages.
These may be divided into <i>three</i> classes, viz. the natural,
chemical, and mechanical.</p>

<p>1st. By using woods which are able to resist the attacks
of sea worms.</p>

<p>2nd. By subjecting piles to a chemical process.</p>

<p>3rd. By adopting a mechanical process.</p>

<p>First. We have not any English woods which resist
their attacks. Elm (used for piles in England) or beech
(used for piles, if entirely under water, in France) cannot
withstand the <i>teredo</i>; while oak cannot battle successfully
against wood-beetles in carvings. It is therefore necessary
to inquire whether foreign woods are any better.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Unfortunately the great expense of importing them into
England prevents their use for piles.</p>

<p>Nearly all our foreign woods used for engineering and
building purposes come from the Baltic or Canada: they
are fir and pine. Memel timber from the Baltic is
comparatively useless unless thoroughly creosoted; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Canadian timber is not so good as the Baltic wood. At
Liverpool and some of the western ports of England
Canadian timber is preferred to Baltic, although we
believe the reason to be that they cannot get the latter,
except in small quantities at a time.</p>

<p>The following is a list of timber woods which, according
to good authorities, resist for a long period of time the
attacks of sea worms. It should be borne in mind, however,
that the timber should be cut, during the proper
season, from a large and full-grown tree; and, to prevent
splitting, it should be kept from the direct action of the
sun when first cut; it should have all the bark and
sapwood removed, and allowed to dry a certain time
before being used.</p>

<p>Second. The chemical, viz. Kyan’s process of corrosive
sublimate; Payne’s process of sulphate of iron and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
muriate of lime; pitching and tarring; Burnett’s process
of chloride of zinc; and arsenic, or other mercurial preparations,
have all failed, with the exception of Bethell’s
process of oil of tar. The failure must proceed from one
of two causes; either that the sea-water decomposes the
poisonous ingredients contained in the wood, or that these
poisonous compounds have no injurious effect on the worms;
it appears, however, that both these causes have been in
operation, principally the latter.</p>

<p>Without a series of the most minute experiments, it is
impossible to form any general notion of the action of
sea-water on timber. Common salt, chlorides of calcium
and magnesium, sulphate of soda, iodides and bromides
of the same metals, are known to exist in sea-water, and
in great abundance in the torrid zone. What effect these
different ingredients may have upon saturated timber it is
difficult to say, but it is extremely probable that they do
have an effect.</p>

<p>With regard to the different poisonous compounds
having no injurious effect on the worms, it should be
remembered that all cold-blooded animals are much more
tenacious of life than those of a higher temperament, and
in descending the scale of animal creation, the tenacity of
life increases, and this principle is more developed. A
frog, which though cold-blooded, is an animal of a much
higher order than the <i>teredo</i>, will not only live in hydrogen
gas, but also in a strong solution of hydrocyanic acid,
while at the same time a single drop placed on the nose
of a rat, or in the eye of a rabbit, would produce instant
death. A somewhat similar occurrence is noticed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
‘British and Foreign Medical Review,’ for July, 1841,
showing the slow effects of prussic acid on the common
snake and turtle.</p>

<p>It may therefore be inferred, that as it requires a large
quantity of the most virulently poisoned matter to destroy
animals of a much higher order than the <i>teredo</i>, it would
take a still greater quantity to affect those animals as
they exist in their own element.</p>

<p>The preserving property of soluble salts, such as corrosive
sublimate, sulphate of copper, &amp;c., was considered to
be founded upon their power of coagulating the albumen,
and the sap of wood, thereby rendering that sap less liable
to decay; but that very quality of combining with the
albumen, destroyed the activity of the poison of the salts.
A given quantity of corrosive sublimate of mercury, which
if administered to a dog would kill it, would, when mixed
with the white of an egg, become coagulated, and if
swallowed in that state would be perfectly harmless; so a
piece of wood, saturated by those salts, could be eaten by
a worm without injury.</p>

<p>A French naturalist, M. de Quatrefages,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> in 1848, suggested
that a weak solution of mercury (corrosive sublimate)
thrown into the water will destroy the milt of
the <i>teredo</i>, and consequently prevent fecundation of the
eggs, thus exhausting the molluscs in the bud. He
proposed that ships should be cleared of this terrible pest
by being taken into a closed dock, into which a few
handfuls of corrosive sublimate should be thrown and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
well mixed with the water. He considered that about
1 lb. of sublimate would be sufficient for 20,000 cubic
metres (metre = 39·37 English inches) of water; but on
account of the cost it would be advisable to use salts of
lead or copper. This proposition of de Quatrefages
reminds us of Chapman’s suggestion, in 1812, to get rid
of dry rot in ships, viz. by sweeping out the hold, laying
from two to four tons of copperas in her bottom, and as
much fresh water let in upon it as would make a saturated
solution to soak into the wood.</p>

<p>M. de Quatrefages placed the four salts he used in
his experiments in the following order, according to
merit: 1st, corrosive sublimate; 2nd, acetate of lead;
3rd, sulphate of copper; and 4th, nitrate of copper.</p>

<p>In America, white oxide of zinc is used as a marine
paint for ships and piles. In the United States Navy
Yard at Gosport it is spoken well of, and very frequently
employed. It is said to be much superior to white-lead,
red-lead, verdigris, or coal-tar, and that timber covered
with two coats of white zinc is neither attacked by the
worm, nor do barnacles attach to it when immersed in
salt water.</p>

<p>We can only find one instance of timber impregnated
with water-glass having been tested against this subtle
foe. Water-glass is certainly worth a further trial.</p>

<p>The instance we refer to occurred about forty years
ago. In 1832, Dr. Lewis Feuchtwanger, of New York,
was permitted by the Ordnance Department, under the
direction of Commodore Perry, to perform experiments
with water-glass on piles in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in various docks. The piles in the docks were destroyed
by the <i>teredo</i> so fast that they <i>had to be replaced every
three years</i>. The experiments proved highly satisfactory:
the piles which had been so treated lasting many years,
without any indication of being attacked by sea-worms.</p>

<p>The reader is referred to some works on water-glass
mentioned below,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> which are worthy of attentive perusal.</p>

<p>Third. The mechanical processes. They are few in
number, and rather expensive.</p>

<p>At Saint Sebastian, in Spain, the piles of the wooden
bridge standing in the sea have been guarded against
the attacks of sea-worms in the following manner: Each
pile is surrounded by a wooden box, and the space between
filled up with cement. After six years it was proved that
the piles were in a perfect condition, whilst the outer
boxes were completely riddled by the worms. A similar
method to this was adopted, some years since, to many of
the piles in the Herne Bay Pier, which were affected by
sea-worms. Several attempts had been made to protect
the timber, by saturating it under various processes, with,
however, only doubtful success. At last, a wooden casing
was formed round each pile, leaving a space of about an
inch all round, which was rammed full of lime or cement
concrete. That process appeared to be perfectly successful,
as the pier-master, who first adopted the method,
stated that some of the piles had been so treated for three
or four years, and although the worms had commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
their ravages, they appeared to have been checked, and
not to have been able to exist when so enclosed.</p>

<p>In 1835, Brunel suggested an easy way of defending
piles, which was to give them in the first instance a coat
of tar; then powder them with brick-dust, which would
render the wood sufficiently hard to receive a coat or two
of cement. This is similar to the Dutch method.</p>

<p>Some foreigners use sheet lead nailed on to piles, and
wrapped close round with well-tarred rope.</p>

<p>Copper sheathing has often been used for the protection
of piling in piers and harbours. The destruction of
copper by the action of sea-water is a matter which has
long occupied the attention of scientific men, and it
appears to be well ascertained that the decay does not
result from the bad quality of the copper, for, according to
Mr. Wilkinson, no difference could be discovered between
the composition of copper that had endured well, and that
which had been rapidly destroyed. Copper sheathing
was used at Southend, but without success, for although
nearly all the piles were covered with it for about 9 feet
or 10 feet, the <i>limnoria</i> not only penetrated between the
copper and the timber, but the copper had decayed to
such an extent as in some cases to be no thicker than the
thinnest paper; it was soft, and peeled off the wood very
easily, and in two or three years would probably have
been entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>Covering the surface of the timber with broad-headed
scupper nails, arranged in regular rows with their heads at
no great distance from each other, is a method which has
been satisfactorily employed in various parts of the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
in Swedish and Danish vessels, even up to the present
time, and, indeed, it was also practised by the Romans.
The scupper-nailed piles at Southend, after twelve years’
exposure to the sea, were perfectly sound, and although
the nails were not driven close together in the first
instance, yet the corrosive action was so great as to form
a solid impenetrable metallic substance, upon which the
worms refused to settle. Scupper nails have been proved
at Yarmouth, as well as at other places, to have protected
timber for forty years, but the process is expensive, as it
costs one shilling per square foot. They should be about
half an inch square at the head.</p>

<p>Captain Sir Samuel Brown, R.N., states that from
numerous experiments and observations, he is satisfied
that at present there is really no specific remedy against
the attacks of sea-worms upon timber, except iron nails.
He proposes to encase the piles with broad-headed iron
nails resembling scupper nails, but considerably larger,
and he says that in the course of a few months corrosion
takes place, and spreads into the interstices. The rust
hardens upon the pile, and becomes a solid mass which the
worm will not touch. Experiments tried at the Trinity
Pier, Newhaven, and Brighton Pier, have established the
effectiveness of his method.</p>

<p>At the Cape of Good Hope, and many other places,
wood piles are cased in iron, and occasionally iron piles
are used instead of wood, at great cost. Further experience
is desirable as to the durability of cast iron<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
water, especially as to its peculiar property of conversion,
after a few years’ immersion in the sea, into a carburet of
iron, closely resembling plumbago, so that it may be
easily cut with a knife. This, of course, diminishes its
powers of resistance acting upon the framing it is intended
to strengthen. In the course of the construction of the
Britannia Bridge, about one hundred thin plates were
delivered, which were not used on account of some error
in their dimensions. They were left on the platform
alongside the straits, exposed to the wash and spray of
the sea; and after about two years were literally so
completely decomposed as to be swept away with a broom
into the water, not a particle of iron remaining.</p>

<p>We have already stated that the chemical processes
have failed with the exception of Bethell’s process of oil
of tar, generally known as the creosoting process. This
method, <i>when properly carried out</i>, thoroughly protects
wood from the ravages of the <i>teredo</i> and other marine
worms. The breakwaters and piers at Leith, Holyhead,
Portland, Lowestoft, Great Grimsby, Plymouth, Wisbeach,
Southampton, &amp;c., have been built with creosoted timber,
and in no case have the <i>Teredo navalis</i>, <i>Limnoria terebrans</i>,
or any other marine worms or insects been found to
attack these works, as certified to by the engineers in
whose charge the several works are placed. In the cases
of Lowestoft and Southampton we are enabled to give the
detailed reports.</p>

<p>A most searching examination, lasting many days, was
made in 1849, upon every pile in Lowestoft Harbour, by
direction of Mr. Bidder; and the report of Mr. Makinson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the Superintendent of Lowestoft Harbour Works, contains
the subjoined statement:</p>

<p>“The following is the result, after a close and minute
investigation of all the piles in the North and South Piers.</p>

<p>“<i>North Pier.</i>&mdash;The whole of the creosoted piles in the
North Pier, both seaward and inside the harbour, nine
hundred in number, are sound, and quite free from <i>teredo</i>
and <i>limnoria</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>South Pier.</i>&mdash;The whole of the creosoted piles in the
South Pier, both seaward and inside the harbour, seven
hundred in number, are sound, and quite free from <i>teredo</i>
and <i>limnoria</i>.</p>

<p>“There is no instance whatever of an uncreosoted pile
being sound. They are all attacked, both by the <i>limnoria</i>
and the <i>teredo</i>, to a very great extent, and the piles in
some instances are eaten through. All the creosoted
piles are quite sound, being neither touched by the <i>teredo</i>
or the <i>limnoria</i>, though covered with vegetation, which
generally attracts the <i>teredo</i>.”</p>

<p>There was only one instance of a piece of creosoted
wood, in Lowestoft Harbour, being touched by a worm,
and that was occasioned by the workmen having cut away
a great part of one of the cross heads, leaving exposed the
interior or heart of the wood, to which the creosote had
not penetrated. At this spot a worm entered, and bored
to the right, where it found creosote; on turning back
and boring to the left, but finding creosote all around, its
progress was stopped, and it then appeared to have left
the piece of wood altogether.</p>

<p>In 1849, Mr. Doswell, who had the conduct of experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
on different descriptions of wood at Southampton,
where the river was so full of the worm that piles of
14 inches square had been eaten down to 4 inches in four
years, reported as follows: “From my examination, last
spring tides, of the specimen blocks attached, on the 22nd
February, 1848, to some worm-eaten piles of the Royal
Pier, I am enabled to report that Bethell’s creosoted
timbers all continue to be unaffected by the worms; that
the pieces saturated with Payne’s solution continue to
lose in substance by their ravages; and that the unprepared
timbers diminish very fast, except the American
elm, which stands as well (or nearly so) as that prepared
by ‘Payne’s solution.’”</p>

<p>On 1st January, 1852, Mr. Doswell ascertained that,
notwithstanding the number of <i>teredines</i> and <i>limnoria</i> to be
found in the Southampton Waters, none of the creosoted
blocks had been attacked by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>According to M. Forestier, similar results have been
obtained at Brighton, Sunderland, and Teignmouth.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to Mr. Pritchard, of
Shoreham, with reference to preserving timber. On
July 26, 1842, he presented a report to the Treasurer of
the Brighton Suspension Chain Pier Company, upon the
preservation of timber from the action of sea-worms. We
give a portion of it, as follows:</p>

<p>“Stockholm tar has been used, and proved to be of
little service; this tar is objectionable owing to its high
price, and also from its being manufactured from vegetable
substances. All tars containing vegetable productions
must be detrimental to the preservation of timber,
especially when used in, and exposed to, salt water. This
tar does not penetrate into the wood, and in a very few
months the salt acid of the sea will eat it all away.</p>

<p>“Common gas or coal tar has been used to a great
extent, and its effects are apparent to all. It does a very
great deal of harm, forms a hard or brittle crust or coat
on the wood, and completely excludes the damp and
unnatural heat from the possibility of escape, owing to its
containing ammonia, which burns the timber, and in a
few years it turns brown and crumbles into dust. Indeed,
timber prepared with this tar will be completely destroyed
on this coast and pier by the ravages of the <i>Teredo navalis</i>,
and the <i>Limnoria terebrans</i>, in five or six years.</p>

<p>“Also Kyan’s patent, or the bi-chloride of mercury, has
been used, but has proved equally useless. The sleepers
Kyanized five years ago, and in use at the West India
Dock warehouses, have been discovered to decay rapidly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and the wooden tanks at the Anti-Dry-Rot Company’s
principal yard are destroyed.</p>

<p>“I would recommend you for the future to use ‘oil of
tar and pyrolignite of iron’ (Bethell’s patent). This
process will, without a doubt, succeed. I have proved in
hydraulic works on this coast that it will fully prevent
the decay in timber piles, destroy sea-worms, and supersede
the necessity of coating the piles with iron nails. In
Shoreham Harbour, for instance, there is a piece of red
pine accidentally infused with pyrolignite of iron, which
after being in use twelve years is perfectly sound.
There is another waleing piece, the very heart of English
oak, Kyanized, and in use only four years, which is like a
honeycomb or network, completely eaten away by the
<i>teredo</i> and other sea-worms. I have fully proved the
efficiency of this method at different harbours and docks.
Sixteen years ago I had timber prepared with it, and in
use on the shores of the Dee, and it is at the present
moment perfectly sound. The pyrolignite of iron must
be used of very pure quality; the timber must be dry;
afterwards the oil of tar must be applied, and not on any
account must it contain a particle of ammonia. The
immense destruction on the coast of timber by the sea-worms,
and the important fact that at the Chain Pier
there are not twenty of the original piles remaining at
the present time, is of itself sufficient to awaken anxiety.”</p>

<p>With regard to the opinion of foreigners on the subject
of creosoting, we cannot do better than quote the report
of the commission or committee (instituted in 1859) of
the Royal Academy of Sciences, Holland, upon the means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of preserving wood from the <i>teredo</i>, published at Haarlem
in 1866. It is as follows:</p>

<p>“To conclude, it results from experiments which the
committee has directed during six consecutive years, that&mdash;</p>

<p>“1st. Coatings of any sort whatever applied to the
surface of the timber in order to cover it with an envelop
upon which the young <i>teredo</i> will not fasten offer a very
insufficient protection; such an envelop soon becomes
damaged, either by mechanical action, such as the friction
of water or ice, or by the dissolving action of water; and
as soon as any point upon the surface of the wood is
uncovered, however small it be, the <i>teredoes</i> of microscopic
size penetrate into the interior of the wood.</p>

<p>“Covering wood with plates of copper, or zinc, or flatheaded
nails are expensive processes, and only defend the
wood as long as they present a perfect and unbroken
surface.</p>

<p>“2nd. Impregnation with soluble metallic salts generally
considered poisonous to animals does not preserve
the wood from the invasions of the <i>teredo</i>; the failure of
these salts is partly attributable to their being soaked out
of the wood by the dissolving action of the sea-water, partly
also to the fact that some of these salts do not appear to
be poisonous to the <i>teredo</i>.</p>

<p>“3rd. Although we cannot venture to say that there
may not be found in the colonies a wood that may resist
the <i>teredo</i>, yet we may affirm that hardness of any timber
is not an obstacle to the perforations of this mollusc. This
has been proved by the ravages it has made on the Gaïac
and Mamberklak woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“4th. The only means which can be confidently regarded
as a preservative against the ravages of the <i>teredo</i> is the
creosote oil; nevertheless, in the employment of this agent
great care should be taken regarding the quality of the
oil, the degree of penetration, and the quality of the wood
treated.”</p>

<p>These results of the experiments of the committee
are confirmed by the experience of a large number of
engineers of ponts et chaussées (bridges and causeways)
in Holland, England, France, and Belgium. For example,
very lately a Belgian engineer, M. Crepin, expressed
himself as follows in his Report, dated 5th February,
1864, upon experiments made at Ostend:</p>

<p>“The experiment now appears to us decisive, and we
think we may conclude that fir timber well prepared with
creosote oil of good quality is proof against the <i>teredo</i>,
and certain to last for a long time. Everything depends,
therefore, upon a good preparation with good creosote oil,
and on the use of wood capable of injection. It appears
that resinous wood is easiest to impregnate, and that white
fir should be rejected.”</p>

<p>M. Forestier, the able French engineer at Napoléon-Vendée
sums up as follows the results of the experiments
undertaken by him in the port of Sables-d’Olonne, viz.:</p>

<p>“These results fully confirm those obtained at Ostend,
and it appears to us difficult not to admit that the experiments
of Ostend and Sables d’Olonne are decisive, and
prove in an incontestable manner that the <i>teredo</i> cannot
attack wood properly creosoted.”</p>

<p>It thus appears that there are three preservative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
methods, which, according to experience, will save timber
piles from the ravages of the worms, viz.: 1st. By using
woods able to resist unaided their attacks. 2nd. The mechanical
method, which is, by covering the piles with
scupper nails, &amp;c. This process is, however, very expensive,
especially as the four sides of the pile must be
covered; and, moreover, it affords no protection to the
timber from internal rot or decay. 3rd. The chemical, or
“creosoting” method. This process is cheaper than the
last; it preserves the wood from decay, and no worms will
touch it.</p>

<p>When unprepared piles are placed in the sea, there is
every probability, sooner or later, of their being attacked by
the <i>teredo</i>. This animal, however, is not left in peaceable
enjoyment of the dwelling which it has constructed, and
the food which it loves, but is liable to be attacked by an
enemy, an <i>annelide</i>, to which the late M. de Haan has
given the name of <i>Lycoris fucata</i>. This animal is to be
found wherever the <i>teredo</i> exists, indeed its eggs and
larva are to be met with in the midst of those of the
mollusc. M. Kater has remarked that the adult <i>lycoris</i>
dwelling in the mud which it enters during winter, and
into which the piles are driven, climbs up the pile to the
hole formed by the <i>teredo</i>, where, in some manner, it
sucks or eats its victim; then having enlarged the
entrance to the hole, it enters and rests in the place of
the <i>teredo</i>. After a time it goes back to the entrance,
and commences to seek for fresh prey.</p>

<p>The <i>lycoris</i> is narrow and not very long, provided
laterally with a great many little feet terminating in points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and covered with hair, and having in front a pair of hard
superior jaws, pointed horns, and the inferior jaws bent
round in the form of hooks. Behind the head are four
pairs of tubuliform gills. It is with these arms that this
little animal pursues and devours the <i>teredo</i>.</p>

<p>One day M. Kater was fortunately able to observe the
operations of the <i>lycoris</i>, One of these animals coming
out of a hole in the wood which he inhabited, seized upon
a <i>teredo</i>, which M. Kater had previously deposited at the
bottom of the vessel containing the wood. He saw the
<i>annelide</i> seize the <i>teredo</i>, hurry away with it to the hole
which he occupied, and so completely devour it that he
finally left only the two valves of the shell. Our illustrations
of the <i>teredo</i> and <i>lycoris</i> are derived from the works
of Mr. Paton and M. Forestier; and our own sketches.</p>

<p>If the <i>lycoris</i> would only destroy the <i>teredo</i>, when
the mollusc was in its infancy, what an invaluable little
annelide it would be!</p>

<p>It appears to us a great pity that the woods we have
named, or some of them, are not brought over to England
in large quantities for harbour works. In Ceylon and
India, the trees are felled by Indian wood-cutters at little
cost; they are then dragged to the river banks by
elephants or buffaloes, to be floated down the rivers to
the different ports, so that labour is cheap. The question
then remains, how to get the woods to England? When
the ‘Great Eastern ship has finished carrying cables,
perhaps its owners will not object to send the ship on a
few voyages with heavy cargoes to India, Demerara, &amp;c.,
bringing home “teredo-proof woods,” <i>at moderate charges
for freight</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, to place the subject in a practical form, we
think the Institute of Civil Engineers, of London, would
be heartily thanked by the engineering world if they
would appoint a committee to inquire into the damages
done to works by sea-worms; why they are found in some
parts of a roadstead or harbour, and not in others; to
consider the different remedies which have been proposed,
their cost, and method of application; what course should
be adopted to prevent sea-water injuriously affecting iron
piles; and lastly, to publish a detailed account of their
experiments and recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE DESTRUCTION OF WOODWORK IN HOT CLIMATES
BY THE TERMITE OR WHITE ANT, WOOD-CUTTER,
CARPENTER BEE, &amp;c., AND THE MEANS OF PREVENTING
THE SAME.</span></h2>

<p>Of the ant proper, or that belonging to the order <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
there are three species<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in particular which attack
timber, viz.:</p>

<p>1st. <i>Formica fuliginosa</i>, or black carpenter ant, which
selects hard and tough woods.</p>

<p>2nd. <i>Formica fusca</i>, or dusky ant, which prefers soft
woods.</p>

<p>3rd. <i>Formica flava</i>, or yellow ant, which also prefers
soft woods.</p>

<p>The carpenter bee prefers particular kinds of wood. In
India it is very fond of cadukai (<i>Tamil</i>) wood, which is
often used for railway sleepers. Round the holes it
makes there is a black tinge, arising, probably, from the
iron in its saliva acting on the gallic acid of the timber.
Providing it meets with the wood it prefers, it is not very
particular whether it is standing timber, or the beams of
a residence.</p>

<p>The termite, or white ant, is a terrible destroyer of wood
in nearly all tropical countries. There are many species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of termite, and all are fearfully destructive, being indeed
the greatest pest of the country wherein they reside.
Nothing, unless cased in metal, can resist their jaws; and
they have been known to destroy the whole woodwork of
a house in a single season. They always work in darkness,
and, at all expenditure of labour, keep themselves under
cover, so that their destructive labours are often completed
before the least intimation has been given. For example,
the termites will bore through the boards of a floor, drive
their tunnels up the legs of the tables or chairs, and consume
everything but a mere shell no thicker than paper,
and yet leave everything apparently in a perfect condition.
Many a person has only learned the real state of his furniture
by finding a chair crumble into dust as he sat upon
it, or a whole staircase fall to pieces as soon as a foot was
set upon it. In some cases the termite lines its galleries
with clay, which soon becomes as hard as stone, and thereby
produces very remarkable architectural changes. For
example, it has been found that a row of wooden columns
in front of a house have been converted into a substance
as hard as stone by these insects. In pulling down the old
cathedral <i>at Jamaica</i>, some of the timbers of the roof,
which were of hard wood, were eaten away, and a cartload
of nests formed by the ants was removed, after being cut
away by great labour with hatchets.</p>

<p>The first indication of a house being attacked by ants
in the tropics is, perhaps, the yielding of a floor board in
the middle of a room, or the top hinge of a door suddenly
leaving the frame to which it had been firmly screwed a
short time before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>That the ants provide for winter&mdash;as not only Dr. Bancroft
and many others, even King Solomon, reports&mdash;is
found to be an error. Where there is an ordinary winter,
the ants lie dormant, during which torpid state they do
not want food.</p>

<p>The greater number of species belong to the tropical
regions, where they are useful in destroying the fallen
trees that are so plentiful in those latitudes, and which,
unless speedily removed, might be injurious to the young
saplings by which they are replaced. Two species, however,
are known in Europe, namely, <i>Termes lucifugus</i> and
<i>Termes rucifollis</i>, and have fully carried out their destructive
character, the former species devouring oaks and
firs, and the latter preferring olives and similar trees. <i>At
La Rochelle</i> these insects have multiplied so greatly as
to demand the public attention.</p>

<p>M. de Quatrefages, who visited one of the spots in which
these destructive insects had settled themselves, gives the
following account of their devastating energy: “The
prefecture and a few neighbouring houses are the principal
scene of the destructive ravages of the termites, but
here they have taken complete possession of the premises.
In the garden not a stake can be put into the ground, and
not a plank can be left on the beds, without being attacked
within twenty-four or forty-eight hours. The fences put
round the young trees are gnawed from the bottom, while
the trees themselves are gutted to the very branches.</p>

<p>“Within the building itself the apartments and offices
are all alike invaded. I saw upon the roof of a bedroom
that had been lately repaired galleries made by the termites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
which looked like stalactites, and which had begun to
show themselves the very day after the workmen left the
place. In the cellars I found similar galleries, which
were either half way between the ceiling and the floor, or
running along the walls and extending, no doubt, up to
the very garrets, for on the principal staircase other
galleries were observed, between the ground floor and the
second floor, passing under the plaster wherever it was
sufficiently thick for the purpose, and only coming to view
at different points where the stones were on the surface,
for, like other species, the termites of La Rochelle always
work under cover wherever it is possible for them to do
so. It is generally only by incessant vigilance that we
can trace the course of their devastations and prevent
their ravages.</p>

<p>“At the time of M. Audoin’s visit a curious proof was
accidentally obtained of the mischief which this insect
silently accomplishes. One day it was discovered that
the archives of the department were almost totally destroyed,
and that without the slightest external trace of any
damage. The termites had reached the boxes in which
these documents were preserved by mining the wainscoting,
and they had then leisurely set to work to devour
these administrative records, carefully respecting the
upper sheets and the margin of each leaf, so that a box
which was only filled by a mass of rubbish seemed to
enclose a file of papers in perfect order.</p>

<p>“The hardest woods are attacked in the same manner. I
saw on one of the staircases an oak post, in which one of
the clerks had buried his hand up to the wrist in grasping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
at it for support, as his foot accidentally slipped. The
interior of the post was entirely formed of empty cells, the
substance of which could be scraped away like dust, while
the layer that had been left untouched by the termites was
not thicker than a sheet of paper.”</p>

<p>It is most probable that these insects had been imported
from some vessel, as they attacked two opposite ends
of the same town, the centre being untouched. M. de
Quatrefages tried many experiments on these insects with
a view of discovering some method of destroying them,
and came to the conclusion that if <i>chlorine</i> could be injected
in sufficient quantities, it would in time have the
desired result.</p>

<p>The termite or white ant is represented by Linnæus
as the greatest pest of both Indies, because of the havoc
they make in all buildings of wood, in utensils, and in
furniture. They frequently construct nests within the
roofs and other parts of houses, which they destroy if not
speedily extirpated. The larger species enter under the
foundations of houses, making their way through the floors
and up the posts of buildings, destroying all before them;
and so little is seen of their operations that a well-painted
building is sometimes found to be a mere shell, so thin
that the woodwork may be punched through with the point
of the finger.</p>

<p>Many kinds of wood <i>in Brazil</i><a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> are impervious to the
termite, which insect generally selects the more porous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
woods, and especially if these are in contact with the
earth. In dry places, and with <i>a free circulation of air</i>, it
does not prefer timber thus situated; and it is found that
roofs of buildings of <i>good</i> and well-seasoned native wood
resist for an indefinite period both the climate and the
termite. As a general rule, Brazilian timber is very
brittle.</p>

<p>It shows the difference of effects between one climate
and another, that in Brazil the more porous and open-grained
timbers are most subject to the attacks of the
white ant, especially if they are in contact with the earth;
but <i>in Australia</i> it is the reverse, for there it is the hardest
description of timber that those insects first attack. There
is one wood in particular, in common use, to which this
remark applies, namely, “Iron Bark.” Its density is
so great that it sinks in water, and its strength is extraordinary,
and yet the wood the white ants are particularly
fond of. In the West Indies, the ants prefer hard woods.</p>

<p><i>At Bahia</i>, the timber is less affected by the termite
than <i>in Pernambuco</i>; but even in the latter place the
white ant does not like dry places with a free circulation
of air.</p>

<p>Mr. Shields, when on a short visit to Pernambuco,
examined some timber bridges, and in one, which had
only been constructed three years, he found the ends of
the timber had been placed in contact with the moist
clay; at those places he could readily knock off the crust
of the wood, and the interior of the wood was almost
filled with white ants: the decay was augmented by the
contact of the wood with the moist clay. We have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
informed that timber for the Government works is stored
to the depth of about 1 foot 6 inches in the sea-sand, to
protect it from the white ants and the <i>teredo</i>; and that in
Pernambuco, since the establishment of the gas-works,
the Brazilian engineers and constructors “pay” over the
ends of all timbers used in buildings with coal-tar.</p>

<p><i>In Ceylon</i>, no timber&mdash;except ebony and ironwood,
which are too hard; palmyra, in <i>northern</i> Ceylon; and
those which are strongly impregnated with camphor or
aromatic oils, which they dislike&mdash;presents any obstacle
to their ingress. Sir Emerson Tennant, in his work on
Ceylon, says: “I have had a cask of wine filled, in the
course of two days, with almost solid clay, and only discovered
the presence of the white ants by the bursting
of the corks. I have had a portmanteau in my tent so
peopled with them in the course of a single night that
the contents were found worthless in the morning. In an
incredibly short time a detachment of these pests will
destroy a press full of records, reducing the paper to
fragments; and a shelf of books will be tunnelled into
a gallery, if it happened to be in their line of march.”</p>

<p>In Ceylon, the huts are plastered over with earth,
which has been thrown up by white ants, after being
mixed with a powerful binding substance (produced by
the ants themselves), and through which the rain and
moisture cannot penetrate. This will hold the walls
together when the entire framework and the wattles
have been eaten, or have become decayed.</p>

<p><i>In the Philippine Islands</i>, ambogues, a strong, durable
wood, suffers much from the termites. Sir John Bowring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in his work on these islands, thus writes of the ravages of
the white ants in the town of Obando, Province of Bulacan,
Philippine Islands: “It appears that on the 18th March,
1838, the various objects destined for the services of the
mass, such as robes, albs, amices, the garments of the
priests, &amp;c., were examined, and placed in a trunk made
of the wood called ‘narra’ (<i>Pterocarpus palidus</i>). On the
19th they were used in the divine services, and in the
evening were restored to the box. On the 20th some
dirt was observed near it, and, on opening it, every fragment
of the vestments and ornaments of every sort were
found to have been reduced to dust, except the gold and
silver lace, which were tarnished with a filthy deposit. On
a thorough examination not an ant was found in any other
part of the church, nor any vestige of the presence of these
voracious destroyers; but five days afterwards they were
discovered to have penetrated through a beam 6 inches
thick.”</p>

<p>The red ant <i>in Batavia</i> (north-west end of Java) is
another devastator. The red ant contains formic acid
(acid of ants) and a peculiar resinous oil. Thunberg<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
has found cajeput effectual in destroying the red ants of
Batavia: he used it to preserve his boxes of specimens
from them. When ants were placed in a box anointed
with this oil, they died in a few minutes.</p>

<p><i>In Surinam</i>, Guiana, several species of worms are produced
in the palm-trees as soon as they commence to rot:
they are called “groo-groo,” and are produced from the
spawn of a black beetle; they are very fat, and grow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the size of a man’s thumb. The groo-groo will very
quickly destroy wood which has commenced to rot.</p>

<p><i>In Surinam</i>, Captain Stedman<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> was obliged to drive
nails into the ceiling of his room, and hang his provisions
from the nails; he then made a ring of dry chalk around
them, very thick, which crumbled down the moment the
ants attempted to pass it. In Guiana, the young ants will
swim across a small pool of water to get at sugar; some
get drowned, the rest get the sugar.</p>

<p><i>In Japan</i>, according to Kœmpfer,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> ants do considerable
damage to wood.</p>

<p><i>In Senegal</i>, the ant (<i>Termite belliqueux</i>) is a formidable
agent of destruction. In a season, all the carpentry of a
house is destroyed by them. Spartimann, in his ‘Voyage
to the Cape of Good Hope,’<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> gives an excellent account of
their methods of working.</p>

<p>The <i>Termite lucifuge</i> has been discovered in the environs
of <i>Bordeaux</i>, in the pine-trees; also in the marine workshops
at <i>Rochefort</i>. It is believed to have been imported
from America.</p>

<p>The <i>Termite flavicole</i>, a few years since, attacked the
olive-trees of <i>Spain</i>, and it occasionally visits the centre
of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>White or yellow pine wood can only be used in the
tropics for doors, movable window frames, bodies of railway
waggons, or other work intended to be kept in motion.
Its use even for these purposes is questionable, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
white ant has such an affinity for it, that a door or a
window which has remained shut for a few weeks will
almost invariably be attacked by that insect.</p>

<p>North American pitch pine withstands very well the
attacks of the termite, when used in the roofs of buildings,
or in any locality not humid; but it is found after a
time, when laid upon the earth, to lose its resisting
powers, as well as to become subject to rapid decay.</p>

<p>“Greenheart” timber in its natural state is proof
against the attacks of this insect in tropical climates&mdash;especially
that known as the “purple-heart” wood.
There are two reasons why it enjoys this immunity from
attack: first, there is its great hardness; and, secondly,
there is the presence of a large quantity of essential oil.
It is very hard and durable wood; a little heavier than
water. It is obtained at Demerara.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Great care is required
in working it, as it is very liable to split. In
sawing it is necessary to have all the logs bound tightly
with chains, failing which precaution the log would break
up into splinters, and be very apt to injure the men working
it.</p>

<p>“Jarrah” wood, from Australia, is also proof against
the attacks of the white ant. It is occasionally liable
to shakes.</p>

<p>“Panao” wood, from the Philippine Islands, gives the
talay oil, which destroys insects in wood.</p>

<p>“Bilian” wood is imported to Bombay, from Sarawak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Borneo. This wood is impervious to the attacks of the
termite, and does not decay when under fresh or salt
water, where it remains as hard as stone.</p>

<p>“Sál” wood, in India, is occasionally touched by the
white ant. This wood, however, requires two years to
season, and it will twist, shrink, and warp whenever the
surface is removed, after many years’ seasoning. Only
about 2 lb. of creosote oil per cubic foot can be injected
into sál wood. “Kara-mardá” is avoided by this little
insect; but when used for planks it requires twelve to
fifteen months’ previous seasoning. “Neem-wood,” used
for making carved images, enables an image to remain
undisturbed by the white ant.</p>

<p>The following is a list of woods which resist for a long
time, if not altogether, the attacks of the termites, or white
ants:</p>

<p>In piles of wooden sleepers which have been lying ready
for use <i>in India</i> for about six months, at least 10 per cent.
have been found destroyed by ants. It has been supposed
that the jarring motion of a train on a railway would
prevent the white ant from destroying the timber sleepers;
but there is reason to doubt this, from the fact that on
an examination of the ‘Hindostan’ steam vessel, a considerable
portion of her timber framing was found to be
eaten away by that destructive insect, particularly in the
parts close to the engine and boilers, where there had been
the greatest amount of vibration. The telegraph posts are
particularly subject to their depredations so long as the
timber is sunk in the ground; but when a metallic socket
is supplied, the wood is safe from their visits. A further
precaution is taken to preserve the lower end of the post
by running liquid dammer into the metallic sheath, so
that the enclosed part of the post is encased with a coating
of resin. The telegraph wires when covered with guttapercha
(a vegetable substance) are also liable to their
attacks.</p>

<p>Numerous expedients have been suggested for getting
rid of this destructive insect, some of which have been
successful, but the majority only partially so.</p>

<p>In India, the timbers of a house infested with white
ants are periodically beaten to drive them away. Of
course, this only succeeds for a short time, as they soon
return.</p>

<p>The salt vessels plying on the coast of India use oil of
tar, and a considerable quantity of castor-oil, mixed with
cow-dung mortar, which, while it adheres to the wood, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
an effectual protection against ants and rot. The earth
oil, or Arracan oil, is considered as good as creosote to
protect wood from ants. It can be obtained at Moulmein
and Rangoon, in leathern bottles or skins, at about 6<i>d.</i>
per gallon.</p>

<p>It used to be a practice <i>in the West Indies</i> to destroy
whole colonies of ants which had built their nests either on
trees or under the roofs of houses, by shooting powdered
arsenic out of a quill into an orifice made into their
covered ways, along which they ascended and descended
from and to the ground.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that the depredations of the white
ant in India costs the Indian Government 100,000<i>l.</i> a year,
which is expended in repairing the woodwork of houses,
barracks, bridges, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When Dr. Boucherie gave up his sulphate of copper
process for the use of the French public, he received <i>a
national reward</i>. If the Indian Government is disposed to
give us <i>a national reward</i>, we could show how it may save
at least half the 100,000<i>l.</i> a year&mdash;which is expended in
repairing the damages done by the white ants&mdash;with little
trouble.</p>

<p>In the Madras Presidency periodical inspections have to
be made, not only with regard to the white ant, but with
respect to the presence and subsequent germination of
vegetable matter or seeds in the mortar. In some instances,
where proper precautions had not been taken, roots had
formed very rapidly, and of such great size as to bodily
dislodge by their pressure large stones from buildings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Therefore, to prevent this germination, a proportion of
“Jagherry,” or coarse native sugar, varying from 2 per
cent. in ordinary work, to from 5 per cent. to 8 per cent.
in arch work, is mixed with the lime.</p>

<p>In 1856, in consequence of the ravages of the white ants
in the King’s Magazine, Fort William, India, the flooring
and powder racks had to be reinstated. Captain A. Fraser,
R.E., had the basement covered with concrete, 4 lb. of
yellow arsenic being added to every 100 cubic feet of
concrete. In the mortar used for the pillars arsenic was
used in the proportion of ½ lb. to every 100 cubic feet of
brickwork; a small quantity of arsenic was also mixed
with the paint, and ½ lb. (four chittacks) of arsenic was
also mixed with every 100 superficial feet of plaster. In
1859 the town mayor reported to the Government that no
traces of white ants had since been found either inside or
outside the building.</p>

<p>Colonel Scott, when Acting Chief Engineer, Madras
Presidency, reported to the Government, December 24,
1858, that the following receipt was used for exterminating
white ants in the Madras Presidency, and was found to be
very successful:</p>

<p>Pound the arsenic and aloes, scrape the soap, mix with
mud, and boil in a large chatty half full of water until it
bubbles; let it cool, and when cold, fill up with cold water.
The mixture should boil for nearly an hour: it is applied
as a wash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>The white ants of Calcutta are small in comparison
with those of the upper provinces.</p>

<p>Colonel Scott, Chief Engineer at Bombay, records
instances of timber being boiled under pressure in various
antiseptic solutions, such as sulphate of copper, arsenious
acid, and corrosive sublimate, with satisfactory results;
but considerable apparatus is necessary, and the expense
forbids its use except in large public works. On the other
hand, in 1847, Mr. G. Jackson, being engaged under
Mr. Rendel, C.E., on works in India, tried several experiments
with Mr. J. Bourne, in order to test the possibility
of preserving timber from the ravages of the white
ant. Ninety pieces of wood, 9 inches long by 4 inches
square, saturated according to the different processes of
Burnet, Payne, and Margary,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> under the direction of the
patentees themselves, were experimented upon, in five
situations, one with a considerable amount of moisture, and
four dry; through inadvertency Mr. Bethell’s specimens
were only tested in the dry positions. The result was,
that where there was moisture the timber was entirely
destroyed, whilst where they were kept dry the result
was better, but still not satisfactory. It seems difficult to
account for these different results obtained by Colonel
Scott and Mr. Jackson; but evidently the same strength
of solutions, and the same qualities and descriptions of
woods, cannot have been used by each gentleman.</p>

<p>Captain Mann and Captain McPherson painted the joists
and planking of several buildings at Singapore with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
<i>gambir composition</i>, and the result was perfect success,
although the buildings had been previously infested with
white ants. Gutta gambir is juice extracted from the
leaves of a plant of the same name (<i>Uncaria gambir</i>)
growing in Sumatra, &amp;c., inspissated by decoction, strained,
suffered to cool and harden, and then cut into cakes of
different sizes, or formed into balls. Chief places of
manufacture, Siak, Malacca, and Bittany; gambir is now
imported to England to a slight extent. The gambir
composition referred to is made as follows: Dissolve
three pints of gambir in twelve pints of dammer-oil over a
slow fire; then stir one part of lime, sprinkling it over the
top to prevent its coagulating and settling in a mass at the
bottom; it must be well and quickly stirred. It should
then be taken out of the cauldron, and ground down like
paint on a muller till it is smooth, and afterwards returned
to the pot and heated. A little oil should be added to
make it tractable, and the composition can then be laid
over the material. To be treated with a common brush.
Against the <i>Teredo navalis</i> may be substituted the same
proportion of black varnish or tar for dammer-oil, of
course omitting the grinding down, which would not
answer with tar.</p>

<p>Burnett’s chloride of zinc process is said to be a good
preservative for wood liable to be attacked by ants: the
zinc penetrates to the heart of the wood.</p>

<p>Creosoted timber, it is well known, resists the attacks of
the white ants; but the close grain of the generality of
tropical timber renders any attempt to creosote it all but
useless. Of course, creosoted fir timber could be, in fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
is, exported from England, but the cost of freight and
other charges will always make it very expensive, and be
a great drawback to its general use abroad. Mr. J. C.
Mellis, Engineer to the Government of St. Helena, writes
in very high terms of creosoted timber as used there,
where the white ant abounds. Between the years 1863
and 1866, experiments<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> were made with many specimens
of woods (by order of the Lieutenant-Governor), in order
to find out those which would resist the white ant. Teak
remained uninjured; jarrah wood was partially destroyed;
while pitch-pine, oak, cedar, ash, elm, birch, beech, and
mahogany, were quite destroyed.</p>

<p>In Ceylon creosoted timber is not attacked by white
ants, but the black coating, if exposed, renders it so heat-absorbing,
that it is apt to split, and, unless thoroughly
impregnated with the creosote, a road is opened to the
inside, and the ants will soon destroy all that part which
is unprotected.</p>

<p>Coal-tar will destroy white ants. Some years ago
Mr. Shields took short baulks of timber where the ants
had commenced operations, and tried the system of
pouring a very small stream of coal-tar through the heart
of the timber which the ants had hollowed out, and afterwards
splitting it open to see the result. He found the
white ants completely destroyed; they were shrivelled up
like shreds of half-burnt paper by the mere effluvium of
the coal-tar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Creosoting is excellent for railway sleepers, piles, &amp;c.,
but it will not do for buildings, which the white ants
prefer. It is objectionable for dwellings; 1st, on account
of its smell, which is disagreeable; 2nd, on account of its
colour, black, which is unsightly; 3rd, on account of its
inflammability.</p>

<p>With regard to the depredations of white ants, anything
of a bitter taste injected into the fibre of the wood prevents
their attacks, though it may not be so good as coal-tar;
even a small quantity of turpentine has the effect of
killing them instantly. Carbolic acid has been used, but
its smell is objectionable. In South America, the leaves
of the black walnut are soaked in water for some hours,
then boiled; and when the liquid has cooled, it is applied
to the skins of horses and other animals, to prevent their
being bitten or “worried” by insects. We do not know if
this has been used as a wash, or injected into wood, to
prevent it being “worried” by ants.</p>

<p>It thus appears that there is no remedy generally
adopted in tropical climates for preventing the depredations
of the white ants; but there is one method very
frequently adopted in hot countries of getting rid of them.
It is a desperate remedy, we admit, but desperate cases
frequently require desperate remedies: it is simply by
<span class="smcapuc">EATING THEM</span>. Europeans have pronounced the termites
to be peculiarly delicate and well flavoured, something
like sweetened cream. The termites are prepared for the
table by various methods, some persons pounding them so
as to form them into a kind of soft paste, while others
roast them like coffee-beans or chestnuts. Termites, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
white ants, are eaten by various African tribes, both raw
and boiled; and it is said that the Hottentots “get into
good condition on this diet.” In India, the natives capture
great quantities of these insects, which they mix up with
flour, producing a kind of pastry, which is purchased at a
cheap rate by the poorer classes. In Ceylon, bears feed
on the termites. Some of the Africans prepare large
quantities of them for food, by parching them in kettles
over a slow fire; in this condition they were eaten by
handfuls as delicious food. The traveller Smeathman
states that he often ate them dressed in this way, and
found them to be “delicate, nourishing, and wholesome,
resembling in flavour sugared cream, or sweet-almond
paste.” In Brazil, the yellow ants are eaten by many
persons. Humboldt states that in some of the South
American countries ants are mixed with resin and eaten
as a sauce. In Siam, ants’ eggs are considered a luxury;
they are sent to the table curried, or rolled in green leaves
mingled with fine slices or shreds of fat pork. In Sweden,
ants are distilled along with rye to give a flavour to the
inferior kinds of brandy. Chemists have ascertained that
ants secrete a pleasant kind of vinegar, or a peculiar acid,
called formic acid.</p>

<p>In Brazil, however, the eating process goes on extensively
as follows:</p>

<p>1st. Ants eat the wood.</p>

<p>2nd. Ant-eaters eat the ants.</p>

<p>3rd. Woodsmen eat the ant-eaters.</p>

<p>4th. Wild animals eat the woodsmen.</p>

<p>Teak-oil, extracted from teak chips, was, in 1857, recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
by a Mr. Brown to the Government of St.
Helena, through the Government of Madras. Timber
coated with this oil, as reported to the Secretary to the
Government of Madras by the several executive engineers
of the Public Works Department, even when placed in a
nest of white ants, was not touched by them. The cost
of this oil, in certain experiments made by order of the
Madras Government, in 1866, was reported to be 6¾ annas
for 1¼ ounce, which is too expensive. In the central provinces
the cost would be 1¼ anna per quart.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In the East Indies there are several species of wood-cutter
(<i>Xylocopa</i>) and carpenter bee (<i>Xylocopa</i>), which confine
their ravages to the wood after it has been felled.
The wood-cutter tunnels through the beams and posts
of buildings, which they frequent in great numbers.
The passages are from 12 to 15 inches long, and more
than half an inch in diameter. If the insects are numerous,
their ravages are dangerously destructive, and they
soon render beams unsafe for supporting the roof.</p>

<p>The carpenter bee of Southern Africa is one of those
curious insects which construct a series of cells in wood.
After completing their burrow, which is open at each end,
they close the bottom with a flooring of agglutinated sawdust,
formed of the morsels bitten off during the operation
of burrowing, lay an egg upon this floor, insert a quantity
of “bee-bread,” made of the pollen of flowers and their
juices, and then cover the whole with a layer of the same
substance that was used for the floor. Upon this is laid
another egg, another supply of bee-bread is inserted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
a fresh layer of sawdust superimposed. Each layer is
therefore the floor of one cell and the ceiling of another,
and the insect makes on the average about ten or twelve
of these cells.</p>

<p>The carpenter bee destroys the woodwork of buildings
in the north of Ceylon, but in the south of the island
woodwork has two enemies to contend against, viz. the
porcupine and a little beetle. The porcupine destroys
many of the young palm-trees, and the ravages of the
cocoa-nut beetle (<i>Longicornes</i>) are painfully familiar to the
cocoa-nut planters. The species of beetle, called by the
Singalese “cooroominya,” is very destructive to timbers.
It also makes its way into the stems of the younger trees,
and after perforating them in all directions, it forms a
cocoon of the gnawed wood and sawdust, in which it
reposes during its sleep as a pupa, till the arrival of the
period when it emerges as a perfect beetle. Mr. Capper
relates that in passing through several cocoa-nut plantations,
“varying in extent from twenty to fifty acres, and
about two to three years old, and in these I did not discover
a single young tree untouched by the cooroominya.”</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Carpenter Bees “at work”.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Sir E. Tennant thus writes of the operations of the
carpenter bee on the wooden columns of the Colonial
Secretary’s official residence, at Kandy, Ceylon: “So
soon as the day grew warm, these active creatures were at
work perforating the wooden columns which supported the
verandah. They poised themselves on their shining
purple wings, as they made the first lodgment in the
wood, enlivening the work with an uninterrupted hum of
delight, which was audible to a considerable distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
When the excavation had proceeded so far that the insect
could descend into it, the music was suspended, but renewed
from time to time, as the little creature came to
the orifice to throw out the chips, to rest, or to enjoy the
fresh air. By degrees a mound of sawdust was formed at
the base of the pillar, consisting of particles abraded by
the mandibles of the bee; and these, when the hollow was
completed to the depth of several inches, were partially
replaced in the excavation, after being agglutinated to
form partitions between the eggs, as they are deposited
within.”</p>

<p>Fortunately in England the owner of a house has no
opportunity of watching (“with an uninterrupted hum of
delight, audible to a considerable distance”) the operations
of the carpenter bee, on the wooden beams and posts
of his building.</p>

<p>We must now <i>consider the ways</i> of the wood-beetle,
which will be found described in the next chapter, and
only write a few words before closing this. A modern
engineer is no sluggard, of that we are certain; but if he
intends erecting large buildings in any of the places
abroad which we have referred to, he will find it very
necessary to pay particular notice of the following words
of King Solomon:</p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE CAUSES OF DECAY IN FURNITURE, WOOD CARVINGS,
ETC., AND THE MEANS OF PREVENTING AND
REMEDYING THE EFFECT OF SUCH DECAY.</span></h2>

<p>Although trunks and boxes are of themselves of little
importance, they derive great consequence from the valuable
deposits of written papers, deeds, books, &amp;c., which
they frequently contain, that are subject to destruction
from timber-destroying insects. It is well known that
the smell of Russian leather, which arises from an essential
oil, is a preservative of books. Leather or woods impregnated
with petroleum, or with oil of coal-tar (which has a
smell not much dissimilar) would be productive of the
same effect, because known to be peculiarly obnoxious to
insects: these oils are, however, very inflammable.</p>

<p>At all times beech-wood is exposed to the attacks of
beetles, and it cannot be used, even for household furniture,
without being impregnated with some kind of oil
or varnish, as a defence against these insects&mdash;a very
curious fact, for the growing trees are remarkably free
from the attacks of wood-devouring insects. Larch being
solid, and its juices hot, pungent, and bitter, is rarely
affected with the larvæ of insects.</p>

<p>Mr. Westwood, Hope Professor of Zoology, Oxford,
says: “The insects which in this country are found to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the most injurious from their habit of burrowing into the
wood of furniture, belong to three species of beetles, of
small size, and cylindrical in form (the better to enable
them to work their way through the burrows in the wood),
belonging to the family <i>Ptinidæ</i>, and known under the
systematic names of <i>Ptilinus pectinicornis</i>, <i>Anobium striatum</i>,
and <i>Anobium tessellatum</i>.</p>

<p>“In the perfect state, the insects of the genus <i>Anobium</i>
are well known under the name of the “deathwatch,” as
these insects produce the ticking noise occasionally heard
in old houses. It is also the <i>Anobium striatum</i> which is so
injurious in libraries; the grub burrowing through entire
volumes, and feeding upon the paper, and especially the
<i>pasted</i> backs of the books.</p>

<p>“The destruction of these insects, when enclosed in
articles of furniture, is by no means easy, although with
care much mischief might be prevented. The saturation
of the wood with some obnoxious fluid previous to its
being used up in the manufacture of objects of value
would be beneficial.</p>

<p>“A strong infusion of colocynth and quassia, spirits of
turpentine, expressed juice of green walnuts, and pyroligneous
acid, have all been proposed. In hot climates
the ravages of the <i>Anobium</i> on books have been prevented
by washing their backs with a fluid compound of corrosive
sublimate (ten grains) and four ounces of alcohol, and the
paste used in the book covers is there also mixed with
alcohol.”</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy and Professor Faraday hesitated to employ
corrosive sublimate as a means of preventing the ravages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of the bookworm in Earl Spencer’s library, at Althorp,
not feeling certain as to whether the quantity of mercury
used would affect the health of the inhabitants. Amongst
all the combinations of mercury, perhaps the bi-chloride,
or corrosive sublimate, is the most terrible poison. It
should be remembered that there are two chlorides of
mercury&mdash;one the proto-chloride, ordinarily known as
calomel; the other, bi-chloride, ordinarily known as corrosive
sublimate; the respective compositions of which
are as follows:</p>

<table summary="Compositions of proto-chloride and bi-chloride of mercury">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Calomel, and Corrosive Sublimate.</th>
    <th colspan="2">Parts by Weight.</th>

    <td>Corrosive sublimate, or bi-chloride of mercury</td>
    <td class="tdr">72</td>
    <td class="tdr">200</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">Hence the ratio of chlorine in these two chlorides is as
one to two.</p>

<p>Botanists have long used a solution of corrosive sublimate
in alcohol, known by the name of Smith’s solution,
to preserve the specimens in their herbaria from the
aggressions of insects.</p>

<p>The Rev. J. Wood, writes:<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> “I know to my cost
sundry Kaffir articles being absolutely riddled with the
burrows of these tiny beetles (<i>Anobium striatum</i>), and not
to be handled without pouring out a shower of yellow dust,
caused by the ravages of the larva. The most complete
wreck which they made was that of a New Guinea bow,
which was channelled from end to end by them, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
many places they had left scarcely anything but a very
thin shell of wood.</p>

<p>“In such cases I have but one remedy, viz. injecting into
the holes spirits of wine in which corrosive sublimate has
been dissolved. This is not so tedious a business as it may
seem to be, as the spirit will often find its way from one
hole to another, so that if half a dozen holes be judiciously
selected, the poison will penetrate the whole piece of wood,
kill all the insect inhabitants, and render it for ever impervious
to their attack. The above-mentioned bow cost
me but little trouble. I first shook out the greater part
of the yellow powder, and then, placing the bow perpendicularly,
injected the spirit into several holes at the
upper end. The effect was magical. The little beetles
came out of the holes in all directions, and not one survived
the touch of the poisoned spirit; many of them,
indeed, dying before they could force themselves completely
out of the holes. The ticking of the deathwatch
is, in fact, the call of the <i>anobium</i> to its mate, and as
the insect is always found in old woods, it is very evident
why the deathwatch is always heard in old houses.
There is, by the way, a species of cockroach which acts
in a similar manner, and generally disports itself on
board ship, where the sailors know it by the name of
‘Drummer.’”</p>

<p>The earliest account<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> we can find of the use of corrosive
sublimate to destroy worms in woods is a few words mentioned,
in 1705, by M. Homberg, French Academian. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
that year he stated that a person of position in Provence,
France, knew how to make a parquet floor which would
resist the worm, viz. by soaking the wood in water in
which corrosive sublimate had been mixed, and this process
he had always found to be very successful.</p>

<p>Herr Temmnick preserved his books from the <i>anobium</i>
by dipping them in a solution of quassia. Except on a
small scale, however, the saturation of furniture seems
scarcely practicable. Fumigation seems, however, to be
more available. For small objects, the practice adopted
at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, on Professor Westwood’s
recommendation, appears good, viz. to enclose a number
of volumes in a box, shutting quite close, and placing a
small quantity of benzine in a saucer at the bottom of the
case. The same plan might be adopted with small ornamental
wood-works, enclosing them in glass cases shut as
nearly air-tight as possible.</p>

<p>The Report of the Commission appointed by the Department
of Science and Art to inquire into the causes
of decay in wood carvings, and the means of preventing
and remedying the effects of such decay, which was published
in 1864, states that the action of the worm in wood
carvings may be arrested, and the worm itself destroyed,
by vaporization, more especially by the vapour of benzine;
and that, after the worm has been destroyed, further
attacks from it can be prevented by treating the carved
work with a solution of chloride of mercury, either in
methylated spirits of wine, or parchment size, according
to the surface character of the carving or woodwork; the
strength of the solution in each case being 60 grains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the chloride of mercury to a pint of fluid, whether spirits
of wine or parchment size. The carving or woodwork
should be placed in a box, made as air-tight as possible,
but with means of renewing the benzine placed in saucers
from time to time as it evaporates without opening the lid
of the box. Gilded carved work and panels on which
pictures have been painted, and which have been attacked
by the worm, can only be treated by applying the fumes
of the benzine to the back of the pictures or gilded carved
work: there is no reason to suppose that the vapour of the
benzine would influence either the gilding of the one or
the colours of the other.</p>

<p>The process should always be carried out during the
spring and early summer months, according to the state
of the temperature and the observations of those in charge
of the carved or other work, as to the action of the worm,
which is manifested by the fine dust falling from the
worm-holes, crevices, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Crace was engaged in 1855 to restore some
of the wood carvings in the Mercers’ Hall, London, which
had been perfectly honeycombed by a small brown beetle
about the size of a pin’s head. The carvings being first
washed, a number of holes were bored in the back by a
gimlet, and also into every projecting piece of fruit and
leaves on the face. The whole was then placed in a long
trough, 15 inches deep, and covered with a solution, prepared
in the following manner:&mdash;16 gallons of linseed oil,
with 2 lbs. of litharge finely ground, 1 lb. of camphor, and
2 lbs. of red lead, were boiled, for six hours, being well
stirred the whole time; 6 lbs. of bees’-wax was then dissolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in a gallon of spirits of turpentine, and the whole
mixed while warm thoroughly together.</p>

<p>In this solution the carving remained for twenty-four
hours. When taken out the face was kept downwards,
that the oil in the holes might soak down to the face of
the carving. The dust was allowed to remain to form a
substance for the future support of the wood, and as it
became saturated with the oil it increased in bulk, and
rendered the carving perfectly solid.</p>

<p>No insect has since been found to touch these carvings,
as they could not subsist on this composition.</p>

<p>In 1855 the carvings of Grinling Gibbons, at Belton
House, were in such a condition as to render it absolutely
necessary that something should be done to prevent their
complete destruction. To this end they were placed in
the hands of Mr. W. G. Rogers, who undertook to experiment
upon their restoration. This gentleman reported
that the first step he took was to have the various pieces
photographed, as a means of recording the position of
each detail of the ornamentation, &amp;c. The whole of the
works were in a serious state of decay, portions being
completely honeycombed by the worm. In order to
destroy or prevent any future development of the insect
within the wood, Mr. Rogers caused the whole to be
saturated with a strong solution of corrosive sublimate
(bi-chloride of mercury) in water. The colour of the wood,
however, suffered so seriously by the action of the mercury
that it was found necessary to adopt some means of
restoring the original tint. (It gives a dark colour to
the wood, which is caused by the metal contained in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
sublimate.) This was effected by ammonia in the first
instance, and subsequently by a slight treatment with
muriatic acid. After this the interior of the wood was
injected with vegetable gum and gelatine, in order to
fill up the worm-holes and strengthen the fabric of the
carvings. A varnish of resin, dissolved in spirits of wine,
was afterwards spread on the surface, and then the dismembered
pieces were put together in conformity with
the photographs taken, as records, prior to the work of
restoration having been commenced.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain the present condition of these
carvings, seven years after the operations detailed had
been completed Mr. Rogers communicated with the Hon.
Edward Cust, one of the trustees of the Earl Brownlow
who desired him to communicate with the clerk of the
works at Belton. Mr. G. A. Lowe. Mr. Lowe, in writing
to Mr. Rogers, informed him that “there is never any
appearance of worm dust from the very beautiful carving
by Gibbons since you preserved it some years back.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers stated, at a meeting of the Royal Institute
of British Architects, a few years since, that similar carvings
at Ditton Park, Cashiobury, and Trinity College,
Oxford, are in a state of decay, the surface or skin, in
some instances, being, covered with a deceptive white
vegetable bloom, which assists in completing the work of
destruction.</p>

<p>Painting hastens the work of destruction. In the
library of Trinity College, Cambridge, some of the finest
carved work at some former time was thickly painted
over, preventing the escape of the insects within, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
were compelled to feed on the last bit of woody fibre,
leaving nothing but the <i>skeleton</i> of what it once was. At
Cashiobury, where can be seen room after room of the
finest of Gibbons’ work, all this charming carving (about
thirty years ago) was covered over and loaded with a
thick brown paint and heavy varnish, destroying all the
delicate feathering of the birds and veining of the leafage,
the repairs being done in plaster or a composition.
Flowers, each about the size of an orange, were thus left
with nothing but a skin of dust, with just enough fibre left
to save them from collapsing in the handling. All the
glorious work of Gibbons in the chapel of Trinity College,
Oxford, was some years since covered with a dirty, undrying
oil.</p>

<p>We dislike painters who paint carvings as much as the
servant who applied to Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; (wife of the celebrated
landscape painter) for an “appointment” as cook, and
having ascertained that the master of the house was a
“painter,” remarked, “I cannot take the situation, ma’am,
as I have never lived in a <i>tradesman’s family</i>.”</p>

<p>It is a difficult process to remove paint from carvings,
as it is not possible to scour and wash it off in the ordinary
way: it must be eaten off by an alkaline solution.</p>

<p>With reference to the restoration of carvings which
have not been painted, but only blackened by time, they
must be scoured by the careful hand of an experienced
man.</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose, the present architect to the Dean and
Chapter of St. Paul’s, a short time ago examined the
beautiful carvings in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
able to state that they have not hitherto been attacked
by worms. “Some portions had been broken by violence,
but the state of preservation was marvellous.” Mr. Rogers
also observed that “he was greatly and agreeably surprised&mdash;contrary
to his expectations&mdash;to find the carvings
in St. Paul’s in so good a state of preservation, and so
free from the attacks of insects; but such was undoubtedly
the fact. How it was so he was not able to say.” Why
was this? Well, Sir Christopher Wren was a wise man,
and when he erected St. Paul’s Cathedral, he engaged an
experienced mason to remain at the Portland stone
quarries, whose duty was to select every block of stone
for the Cathedral, and when it arrived in London it was
placed <i>on its natural bed</i>. The good results of this precaution
can now be seen in the good preservation of the
stone at the present time. If he was so careful of the
stone for the walls, no doubt equal care was taken in
the selection of the wood for carvings. Besides, the
<i>instructions</i><a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> to the commissioners for rebuilding St. Paul’s
were drawn up with a view of preventing decay. The
following is an extract from these instructions:</p>

<p>“And to call to your Aid and Assistance such skilful
Artists, Officers, and Workmen as ye shall think fit, and
to appoint each of them his several Charge and Employment;
to minister to such Artists and Officers, and to all
and every other person and persons to be imployed in the
said service, to whom you shall think meet, such Oath or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Oatlis for the due performance of their several Duties,
Employments, Offices, Charges and Trusts to them or any
of them to be committed as shall by you be thought
reasonable and convenient; and out of such Money as
shall be received for this Work, to allow to them, and
every of them, such Salaries, Wages, and Rewards respectively
as to you shall seem fitting and proportionable to
their Employment and the Service they shall do.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Sir Christopher Wren was descended from Dutch ancestors:
he was building for a Dutch king, and we therefore
perceive the reason why so much Dutch wainscot was
introduced by him into England.</p>

<p>It seems a great pity that the beautiful carvings of
Grinling Gibbons and others should be allowed to go to
decay for want of proper attention. Why should this be?
We are acquainted with some of Gibbons’ carvings, particularly
those in St. James’s Church, Piccadilly, London;
but whether they are in a state of decay unknown to any
one, whether any one looks after them, or whether it is
“nobody’s business” to do so, we cannot say. Every now
and then the owner of some beautiful wooden carvings
suddenly becomes acquainted with the fact that they are
thoroughly riddled through by worms, and instead of having
them looked after, they are pointed at as curiosities.
Even the makers of “old furniture” take care that it
shall be bored all over, to imitate the borings of worms.</p>

<p>But what can be the cause of this decay? It must
arise from one of two causes; or, it may arise from both,
viz. either the wood was not seasoned when fixed; or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the quality and description of the wood for carving purposes
was not attended to. There cannot be smoke without cause,
and worms cannot exist unless a suitable habitation is
first provided for them. Hard white oak is close grained,
and will scarcely admit moisture; whilst on the other
hand the soft foxy-coloured oak from some parts of
Lincolnshire, and other places, is so porous as to imbibe
it easily and retain it; and consequently is liable to early
decay: in fine, the heart of this is scarcely equal to the
sap of hard white oak.</p>

<p>The English woods least liable to the worm for carvings
are cedar, walnut, plane, and cypress; those most liable
are beech, pear, alder, ash, birch, sycamore, and lime.
All the fine carvings at Blenheim, Kidlington, and Wimpole
are in <i>yellow deal</i>, while in the age just before nothing
but lime-tree and soft wainscot were used. The beautiful
carvings of Gibbons, in the chapel of Trinity College,
Oxford, are wrought in costly scented cedar and rich dark
oak; those in Trinity College, Cambridge, in white lime-tree
wood.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that wood to be used for carving
should be hot, pungent, and bitter: thoroughly obnoxious
to wood-destroying insects. If we cannot obtain this
wood in England, we certainly can abroad, and one shipload
would last a long time for such purposes. Take, for
instance, the <i>Jarrah</i> of Western Australia; the <i>Determa</i>,
the <i>Cabacalli</i>, and <i>Kakatilly</i>, of British Guiana; and the
<i>Sepe</i>, of Trinidad: these woods are much valued where
they grow, and no insects ever attack them. We do not
say that they are suitable for wood carvings, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
might be tried, and we certainly know they are not likely
to be worm-eaten at the end of a few years. They need not
be discarded on account of their hardness; boxwood is
hard, but some good carvings have been executed with
boxwood. We can relate an anecdote about this wood.
On 3rd June, 1867, Mr. W. G. Rogers, the celebrated
wood-carver (would that he were alive now to read these
words), was asked, at the Royal Institute of British Architects,
if boxwood is objectionable for wood carvings,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and
he did not reply to the question; if he had given his
opinion it would have been a valuable one, coming from
such an authority. We must therefore get Mr. Rogers’
opinion of this wood in another way. If the reader will
refer to the “Reports by the Juries,” English Exhibition,
1851, vol. ii., page 1555, he will find the following words:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">W. G. Rogers</span>, of London.&mdash;A cradle executed in
boxwood for Her Majesty Queen Victoria, and richly
ornamented with carved reliefs; also, a group of musical
instruments, among which may be especially noticed a
violin. These works show an extraordinary dexterity in
the treatment of the material, and the ornaments of the
cradle are in excellent taste. Prize medal.”</p>

<p>We have already referred to the Report of the Commission
on the Decay of Wood Carvings, and as this
report is now rather difficult to be obtained, we propose
condensing some extracts from it, which may prove of
value to the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the three species of beetles injurious to furniture
and carved work, the first, <i>Ptilinus pectinicorius</i> is about
one-fourth of an inch in length, and the male is distinguished
by its beautiful branched antennae; the second,
<i>Anobium striatum</i>, which is by far the commonest and
most destructive, is about one-eighth of an inch long and
of a brown colour, with rows of small dots down the back;
and the third, <i>Anobium tessellatum</i>, is about one-third to
one-fourth of an inch long, the back varied with lighter
and darker shades of brown scales.</p>

<p>These insects are produced from eggs deposited by the
females in crevices of the woodwork, from which are
hatched small white fleshy grubs resembling the grubs of
the cockchafer in miniature, which generally lie curled
upon their sides,’ making very little use of their six small
feet fixed near the head; it is in this state that the insect
is chiefly injurious, although the perfect insect itself also
feeds on the wood. These grubs make their burrows
generally in the direction of the fibre of the wood; but
when it becomes thoroughly dry and old, they burrow in
all directions.</p>

<p>When full grown they cease eating, cast off their larva
skins, and appear as inactive chrysalids with all the limbs
lying upon the breast inclosed in little sheaths: after a
short time the perfect insect bursts forth.</p>

<p>The appearance of the insects in the perfect state takes
place uniformly during the first hot days at the beginning
of summer. Where they take a liking to a piece of woodwork,
they seem to devour every particle of it, and as the
perfect insects possess large wings beneath their hard wing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
sheaths, they are often seen flying in the hot sunshine out
of doors, evidently in search of suitable woodwork for
themselves and their progeny.</p>

<p>Experiments were made by Mr. G. Wallis, Secretary to
the Commission, with a view of ascertaining the best
means of stopping the decay when commenced. The
course pursued, as well as the results arrived at, will be
best illustrated by a summary of Mr. Wallis’s report on
the subject.</p>

<p>The experiments may be placed under two heads, viz.
Vaporization and Saturation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">I. Vaporization.</span></h3>

<p>At the end of April, 1863, when, from the appearance
of certain specimens of carved work, the worm appeared
to be developed and active, a large glass case, made as
air-tight as circumstances would permit, was filled with
examples of furniture, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The bottom of this case was covered with white paper,
and the specimens of woodwork were raised above the
surface by placing blocks of wood at convenient points.
This insured the free circulation of the vapour over the
whole surface of the objects. A dozen small saucers, with
pieces of sponge saturated with carbolic acid, were distributed
about the bottom of the case.</p>

<p>The raising of the objects on blocks of wood facilitated
the placing of these saucers at any desirable
point.</p>

<p>The carbolic acid was, in this experiment, renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
every three or four days for a month, and a strong vapour
pervaded the case for that period, daring which there was
no appearance of worms, dead or alive. At the end of
May the saucers were removed, and the doors of the case
thrown open, so that it might be well ventilated and
cleared of vapour, after which it was closed again; but
the saucers were not replaced. This closing of the case
without using the vapour was to prevent the escape of any
beetles which might make their appearance, in the event
of the vapour of the creosote not having destroyed the
worms. About the middle of June, a fortnight after the
case was closed again, beetles were seen crawling upon the
white paper with which the bottom was covered. These
beetles would, no doubt, deposit their ova in the usual
course, as they could not escape, and a considerable
number of them were found dead upon the white paper
with which the surface underneath the carved work was
covered.</p>

<p>In order to test the efficacy of chloroform and benzine,
two small glass cases, as nearly air-tight as possible, were
selected, in which were arranged early in May specimens
of ornamental woodwork, all more or less in bad condition
from the worm. The bottom of each, as in the
previous experiments, was covered with white paper; and
the objects to be acted upon raised upon small blocks of
wood. In one case chloroform was used, and in the other
benzine in a similar manner to the carbolic acid, i. e. by
placing small pieces of sponge in saucers and saturating
them with the liquid, using five saucers in each case.
Both the chloroform and the benzine had to be renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
much oftener than the carbolic acid, as the liquid evaporated
much quicker.</p>

<p>Within a week after the experiment commenced it was
evident that the action of the chloroform had destroyed the
worms as they came to maturity, and in a fortnight all
the specimens of carved work having been taken from the
case, and the dust produced by the action of the worms
shaken out, a number of dead ones were found, as also
some dead beetles; but these were evidently those of past
seasons remaining in the crevices of the woodwork.</p>

<p>On examining the specimens of carved work placed in
the case treated with benzine, there was no appearance of
worms or beetles dead or alive.</p>

<p>The two cases, with their contents, were then kept open
for a week, and thoroughly ventilated to clear them
as far as possible of all fumes of either chloroform or
benzine.</p>

<p>After this they were closed again, being then free from
all traces of vapour, and were not opened for some
months. Throughout the summer, the temperature being
the same as that under which beetles appeared in the case
treated with carbolic acid, no traces of worms or insects
were visible, nor could the remains of any be discovered
on the white paper, with which the lower surface of each
case was covered.</p>

<p>It would appear then, as far as vaporization is concerned,
that the action of the vapour of carbolic acid is
not sufficient; in fact, it is sluggish and heavy, whilst
chloroform and benzine are volatile and penetrating. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
experiment with chloroform appears to prove that the
vapour kills the worm, and, as no beetles appeared in the
case during the summer, it may be inferred that it <i>killed
all</i> the worms within its influence.</p>

<p>From the pungency and penetrative action of the
benzine, as also its volatile character and the fact that no
life in the form of either worm or beetle was manifested
in the case in which it was used, it seems fair to infer that
it is more effective than even the chloroform.</p>

<p>Vaporization on a large scale might be adopted by
having a room made as air-tight as possible, stopping up
the chimney, pasting the window frames, &amp;c., and placing
infected furniture in the room, burning brimstone, or filling
the room with fumes of prussic acid, chloroform, or benzine.
It would have to be practised at the time when the perfect
beetles made their appearance; their destruction at that
time involving, of course, the prevention of further injury
by their progeny.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">II. Saturation.</span></h3>

<p>The experiments made with bi-chloride of mercury
(corrosive sublimate) and methylated spirits of wine were
not so successful as by vaporization, on account of the
woodwork when dry (after having been saturated with the
solution) having a varnished appearance.</p>

<p>No experiment as to the effect of saturation in a
solution of corrosive sublimate in water was made: 1st,
because of the great risk to delicate carvings or pieces of
furniture by their immersion in water, or the bringing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of the grain of the wood by treatment with a brush; and
2nd, because the vaporization by benzine appeared to be
quite sufficient to destroy the larvæ.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before terminating this chapter, we trust a few words
about carvers and carvings will not be out of place.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of carvers, the <i>house carvers</i> and
the <i>ship carvers</i>; the former are used to flat and square
surfaces, the latter to the rake or fay, as was the old
term.</p>

<p>About the period of Louis XIV. Malines was remarkable
for its wood carvers, and the inhabitants might be
seen sitting at their doors in the streets, plying their art
in the same manner as now in many of the German and
Swiss towns. Many works of art and decoration of
Flemish origin are still preserved in England;<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> the
works of Flemish carvers in wood were in great esteem,
and there are numerous fine examples in the churches
of Norfolk, and other parts of England which may be
regarded as their productions. Evelyn remarked that
Gibbons came from the Low Countries.</p>

<p>Grinling Gibbons created a school of carvers in England,
and adopted a style and manner in building up his
fruit and flowers to produce a grand effect. He chose
but very few varieties of these out of his own garden, and
it is wonderful how he varied and played with those few.
He originated a peculiar description of light interlacing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
scroll-work, which is to be met with in his best works;
no one has successfully attempted to carry it on since his
time. There are several examples at Belton, and in the
chapel and state rooms at Chatsworth, in the fine trophies
at Kirthington Park; but the upper part of the reredos
of St. James’s, Piccadilly, is a marvellous specimen.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The horizontal bands on the great organ in St. Paul’s
Cathedral are the perfection of this character of foliated
scroll-work.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Gibbons’ carvings have a loose freedom about them.
At Chatsworth he educated his workmen, who partook of
his inspiration. There is a great deal of his work scattered
over the rooms, great hall, and staircase of Lyme
Hall, near Disley, which was erected under the direction
of Sir C. Wren. It was executed by the persons who
were employed at Chatsworth, and took nine years to
complete.</p>

<p>At Blenheim there are some fine specimens of Chippendale’s
work, but what it all means is a mystery. Such a
mixture of scraggy birds, and flowers cut into shreds,
pagodas, and rustic waterfalls&mdash;all this fine workmanship
employed to produce nothing but an incongruous whole
of absurd objects. There is a leading line in all these
works, indicating what the old carvers used to call the C
and G style; because if you attempt to draw it, it will
resolve itself into these two letters. There is also the
S and G style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Abolish painting and we shall again have some fine
house carvers.</p>

<p>We have already given the conclusions at which the
Commission appointed by the Department of Science and
Art arrived, as to the prevention of decay or attack by
these insects, and will now conclude this chapter by
quoting Dean Swift’s recipe for getting rid of the Anobium
or Death watch:&mdash;</p>

<span class="smaller">SUMMARY OF CURATIVE PROCESSES.</span></h2>

<p>The following summary of the most approved formula
for preventing and curing the evils of rot is prepared
from the works of Tredgold and Wylson; some other
more modern receipts have been added from ‘The
Builder,’ ‘Architect,’ ‘Building News,’ and other professional
periodical publications. Discretion in their use
is recommended, and in serious cases we decidedly recommend
consulting a professional man who is well acquainted
with the subject.</p>

<h3>TO PRESERVE WOODWORKS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO
WET OR DAMP.</h3>

<p>1. For those of an extensive nature, such as bridges,
&amp;c. The Hollanders use for the preservation of their
sluices and floodgates, drawbridges, and other huge beams
of timber exposed to the sun and constant changes of the
atmosphere, a certain mixture of pitch and tar, upon
which they strew small pieces of shell broken finely&mdash;almost
to a powder&mdash;and mixed with sea-sand, and the
scales of iron, small and sifted, which incrusts and preserves
it effectually.</p>

<p>2. A paint composed of sub-sulphate of iron (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
refuse of the copperas pans), ground up with any common
oil, and thinned with coal-tar oil, having a little pitch
dissolved in it, is flexible, and impervious to moisture.</p>

<p>3. Linseed oil and tar, in equal parts, well boiled
together, and used while boiling, rubbed plentifully over
the work while hot, after being scorched all over by wood
burnt under it, strikes half an inch or more into the
wood, closes the pores, and makes it hard and durable
either under or out of water.</p>

<p>4. For fences, and similar works, a coating of coal-tar,
sanded over; or, boil together one gallon of coal-tar and
2½ lb. of white copperas, and lay it on hot.</p>

<h3>TO PREVENT ROT.</h3>

<p>1. Thoroughly season the wood before fixing, and when
fixed, have a proper ventilation all round it.</p>

<p>2. Charring, after seasoning, will fortify timber against
infection, so will a coating of coal-tar.</p>

<h3>TO CURE INCIPIENT DRY ROT.</h3>

<p>1. If very much infected, remove the timber, and
replace with new.</p>

<p>2. A pure solution of corrosive sublimate in water, in
the proportion of an ounce to a gallon, used hot, is considered
a very effectual wash.</p>

<p>3. A solution of sulphate of copper, half a pound to
the gallon of water, laid on hot.</p>

<p>4. A strong solution of sulphate of iron; this is not so
good as sulphate of copper.</p>

<p>5. A strong solution of sulphates of iron and copper in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
equal parts, half a pound of the sulphates to one and a
half gallon of water.</p>

<p>6. Paraffin oil, the commonest and cheapest naphtha and
oil, or a little resinous matter dissolved and mixed with
oil, will stay the wet rot.</p>

<p>7. Remove the parts affected, and wash with dilute
sulphuric acid the remaining woodwork.</p>

<p>8. Dissolve one pound of sulphate of copper in one
gallon of boiling water, then add 1¼ lb. of sulphuric acid
in six gallons of water, and apply hot.</p>

<h3>TO PREVENT WORMS IN TIMBER.</h3>

<p>1. Anointing with an oil produced by the immersion of
sulphur in aquafortis (nitric acid) distilled to dryness,
and exposed to dissolve in the air.</p>

<p>2. Soaking in an infusion of quassia renders the wood
bitter.</p>

<p>3. Creosoting timber, if the smell is not objectionable.</p>

<p>4. Anointing the timber with oil of spike, juniper, or
turpentine, is efficacious in some degree.</p>

<p>5. For small articles, cover freely with copal varnish in
linseed oil.</p>

<h3>TO PREVENT WORMS IN MARINE BUILDING.</h3>

<p>1. A mixture of lime, sulphur, and colocynth with
pitch.</p>

<p>2. Saturating the pores with coal-tar, either alone or
after a solution of corrosive sublimate has been soaked
and dried into the wood.</p>

<p>3. Sheathing with thin copper over tarred felt is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
esteemed the best protection for the bottoms of ships
for all marine animals; the joints should be stopped with
tarred oakum.</p>

<p>4. Studding the parts under water with short broad-headed
nails.</p>

<h3>TO DESTROY WORMS IN CARVINGS.</h3>

<p>1. Fumigate the wood with benzine.</p>

<p>2. Saturate the wood with a strong solution of corrosive
sublimate: if used for carvings, the colour should be
restored by ammonia, and then by a weak solution of hydrochloric
acid; the holes may be stopped up with gum
and gelatine, and a varnish of resin dissolved in spirits of
wine should afterwards be applied to the surface.</p>

<p>3. Whale-oil and poisonous ointments have been found
of service.</p>

<p>The wood should be carefully brushed before being
operated upon.</p>

<h3>TO DESTROY ANTS AND INSECTS IN WOOD.</h3>

<p>1. Corrosive sublimate is an effectual poison to them.</p>

<p>2. Oils, especially essential oils, are good preventives.</p>

<p>3. Cajeput-oil has been proved effectual for destroying
the red ant.</p>

<p>4. Payne’s, Bethell’s, and Burnett’s processes are said to
be proof against the white ant of India.</p>

<p>5. Dust the parts with pounded quicklime, and then
water them with the ammoniacal liquor of gas-works,
when the ammonia will be instantly disengaged by the
quicklime, and this is destructive to insect life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>6. For the black ant, use powdered borax; or smear the
parts frequented by them with petroleum oil; or syringe
their nests with fluoric acid or spirits of tar, to be done
with a leaden syringe; or pour down the holes boiling
water to destroy their nests, and then stop up the holes
with cement. Ants dislike arsenic, camphor, and creosote.</p>

<p>The preceding remedies are not by any means given
with the intention of superseding the previous chapters,
which should be carefully studied by those who wish to
acquire a moderate knowledge of the subjects.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">GENERAL REMARKS AND CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p>Our task is nearly completed: we have but few general
remarks to make.</p>

<p>The decay of wooden sleepers, posts, &amp;c., on our railways
and the destruction of timber piles by worms have
been the causes of directing the attention of engineers to
the preservation of timber. Most of our leading engineers
now have the greater portion of the timber used in their
works either creosoted or injected with chloride of zinc.
Architects, as a rule, do not, unfortunately, adopt any
process for preserving timber from rot and decay; and
have practically no guarantee that timber used in
their works has been thoroughly seasoned: posterity will
not thank them for this, and yet they are not solely to
blame. The fault in a great measure rests with the
public, who require buildings to be erected at the least
cost and in the shortest possible time. Moreover, the
works executed by our leading builders are so extensive,
that they have no room in their yards for large piles of
timber to lie and season; and even if they had room it is
doubtful if they would allow so much material, representing
money, to remain idle. We are acquainted with one
instance where a London architect, about a dozen years
ago, erected a public building. The front of the reporters’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
gallery was formed of oak panelling; and within a year
after the completion of the building narrow slips or
tongues of wood had to be let in in several places to fill
up the holes formed by the shrinkage of the panels.
Similar cases to this are by no means rare. We can quote
another instance of unseasoned wood. A range of workshops
was erected a few years since in South London;
the principals of the roof were not ceiled; almost before
the building was finished the upper floor was occupied by
a battalion of workwomen. The heat of the room (the
ventilation being defective) soon had an effect upon the
tie-beams, but one beam, which we imagine was unseasoned,
in consequence of large shakes and splits, had
to be taken out and replaced with new. We will (as
a lawyer would say), cite one more case. A church in
Surrey required some extensive repairs to the roof: an
architect and a builder were employed, and the necessary
works were done. Within four years dry rot has made its
appearance on the new timbers of the roof (not an air-tight
one). One of the churchwardens, on consulting us
last year (1874) as to the best means of stopping the rot,
energetically remarked, “Who is responsible to us for this,
the architect or the builder?” Charles Dickens, in his
edition of ‘Bleak House’ in 1868, wrote, with reference
to long Chancery suits, “If I wanted other authorities for
Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I could rain them on these
pages.” We are able to make a similar remark with
reference to any more instances of dry rot. According to
the 7th chapter of the First Book of Kings, “Solomon
was building his own house thirteen years:” we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
spare so much time now-a-days over the erection of a
house, but that is no reason why our timber should not
be naturally or artificially seasoned.</p>

<p>If we cannot obtain naturally seasoned timber, by
all means let us have artificially seasoned wood. Tredgold,
in his Report on Langton’s system,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> nearly arrived
at the secret. We will quote a few words from his
Report:</p>

<p>“Mr. Langton having discovered a new method of
seasoning timber … by which the time necessary to
season green timber, and render it fit for use, is only
about twice as many weeks as the ordinary process requires
years; … it is more economical, and locks up
less capital than the common method.”</p>

<p>We believe we may say that the number of our public
buildings which have been erected during the present
century with artificially prepared timber can be counted
on our eight fingers (without troubling our thumbs) and
not exceed that number;<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and yet we hear of dry rot in
the great dome of the Bank of England and other buildings
without profiting by the events. We should like to
know if the wooden dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral is safe
from dry rot, (the domes at the Panthéon and the Halle-au-Blé
at Paris were affected,) <i>and plumbers fires</i>.</p>

<p>It is evident that a preservative process, thoroughly
suitable for everyday use and applicable to buildings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
has yet to be invented: it should be cheap, should render
wood uninflammable, should preserve the wood from
decay and dry rot, <i>should not harden the wood until some
time after its application</i>, and should be colourless and
invisible. The invention of such a process will require
careful thought and experiments, for it appears to us that
the whole theory of any successful plan for the prevention
of the dry rot must resolve itself into the <i>solidifying
or coagulation of albumen</i>: this means hardening the
sap-wood, and causing increased difficulty in working the
wood. We can easily illustrate our remarks, by quoting
one of the latest patents for preserving timber, which has
recently been made public. It is the invention of a
gentleman living in England, who has discovered a means
of making wood uninflammable, preventing dry rot and
decay, and rendering white and yellow pine, both in hardness
and appearance, like teak and oak. We have no
objection to its rendering wood uninflammable, providing
it does not “hurt” the wood; but can the reader believe
that any architect, in erecting a moderate-sized villa,
would specify that all the joiners’ work, staircases, window-frames
and sashes, architraves, skirtings, doors, &amp;c., must
be formed of wood <i>as hard as teak</i>; or rather, can the
reader imagine the architect’s client would be agreeable
to pay the greatly increased cost for the extra labour
involved. We do not think this invention will ever be
used, at least to any extent, in buildings.</p>

<p>Much yet remains to be done with regard to uninflammable
wood for buildings: we think the matter should be
dealt with (with reference to joists, floor boards, partitions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
doors, staircases, roof timbers, &amp;c.) by a new Buildings
Act of Parliament. Stone and iron will not burn, but
they are not fire-resisting: brick, artificial stone, and incombustible
wood will give us all we desire; the details
may be difficult of arrangement, but builders would
comply with them if they were imperatively required.
At present our houses are formed of brick walls, every
room being separated vertically and horizontally from the
adjoining rooms by combustible wooden walls. A street
built up of fire-proof buildings would be a novelty. The
whole subject requires to be dealt with thoroughly, for
while we have combustible wooden floors, partitions, &amp;c.,
we cannot at the same time have a fire-proof building.
We have not been able to spare the space, or else we
should have devoted a long chapter to this subject; a
superficial consideration (such as alum and water) would
have been practically useless.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we can only summarize our remarks on
the cause of dry rot, by saying, “Season and ventilate,”
in every case: as to the cure, that is not so easy to deal
with. If the reader has ever had a decayed tooth aching,
a friend has probably said, “Have it out;” and we
say, wherever there is a piece of timber decayed in a
building which can be removed, “Have it out, and stop
up with new;” and in so advising we are merely following
the advice to be found in a good old volume, which has
never yet been equalled, and which says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow
strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall; …
Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the
city: And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and
they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an
unclean place: And they shall take other stones, and put them in the
place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaister
the house.”&mdash;<i>Leviticus</i> xiv. 37, 40, 41, and 42.</p>

</div>

<p>This course will not, however, suit every case, for when
the rot has spread in many directions, the best and cheapest
course is to consult some professional man, well versed in
the peculiarities of dry rot, before determining upon any
remedy, for we have shown in the course of this work that
the disease may arise from various causes; and it is not
a difficult matter to select the wrong remedy, and thus
increase the disease.</p>

<p>We trust the reader has found in this volume at least
some hints which may be of service to him. A <i>new</i> house
affected with dry rot is an unhealthy one to live in, and
an <i>old</i> one is worse than the new; we mean the kind of
house referred to in one line by an American poet, as
follows:</p>

<p>“It is no disparagement to the many excellent publications we refer to, to say that in our
opinion this little pocket-book of Hurst’s is the very best of them all, without any exception.
It would be useless to attempt a recapitulation of the contents, for it appears to contain almost
<i>everything</i> that anyone connected with building could require, and, best of all, made up in a
compact form for carrying in the pocket, measuring only 5 in. by 3 in., and about ¾ in. thick,
in a limp cover. We congratulate the author on the success of his laborious and practically
compiled little book, which has received unqualified and deserved praise from every professional
person to whom we have shown it.”&mdash;<i>The Dublin Builder.</i></p>

measuring but 2½ in. by 1¾ in., yet these dimensions faithfully represent the size of the handy

continually arise under which the young engineer is completely at a loss as to how to obtain
a diagram. All uncertainty will be removed by referring to the book under consideration:
here we have drawings of the arrangements to be adopted under every conceivable circumstance,

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This work is not, in any sense, an elementary treatise, or history of the steam engine, but
is intended to describe examples of Fixed Steam Engines without entering into the wide
domain of locomotive or marine practice. To this end illustrations will be given of the most
recent arrangements of Horizontal, Vertical, Beam, Pumping, Winding, Portable, Semiportable,
Corliss, Allen, Compound, and other similar Engines, by the most eminent Firms in
Great Britain and America. The laws relating to the action and precautions to be observed
in the construction of the various details, such as Cylinders, Pistons, Piston-rods, Connecting-rods,
Cross-heads, Motion-blocks, Eccentrics, Simple, Expansion, Balanced, and Equilibrium
Slide-valves, and Valve-gearing will be minutely dealt with. In this connection will be found
articles upon the Velocity of Reciprocating Parts and the Mode of Applying the Indicator,
Heat and Expansion of Steam Governors, and the like. It is the writer’s desire to draw
illustrations from every possible source, and give only those rules that present practice deems
correct.</p>

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
